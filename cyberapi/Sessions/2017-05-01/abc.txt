According to Denmark-based\nHeimdal Security, the potent 9-year-old malware ZeuS has morphed into the up-and-coming Atmos\nmalware \u2013 now targeting banks in France. \n\nResearchers are warning that the criminals\u00a0behind Atmos have been putting the finishing touches on\nthis latest malware threat \u2013 perfecting how, where and what it will target. For now, Heimdal\nSecurity said, it\u2019s focused on banks, but tomorrow the sky is the limit. \n\nA digital analysis of Atmos shows the malware is part of a ZeuS strain that dates back to 2007.\nThat\u2019s when ZeuS malware earned notoriety for compromising nearly 75,000 websites owned by the likes\nof ABC, Bank of America and Oracle. In 2013, the ZeuS code was used to construct Citadel malware,\nknown for its cunning ability to steal personal, banking and financial information. \n\n\u201cWe had hoped to have seen the last Citadel and ZeuS long ago,\u201d said Morten Kjaersgaard, CEO of\nHeimdal Security. \u201cBut this malware strain has demonstrated astonishing resiliency as malware\nauthors continue to adapt the base code and elements for modern times,\u201d he said. \n\nHeimdal Security said it has observed Atmos active in the wild for the past 30 days, however the\nmalware dates back to late 2015 when it was first identified. The security firm said Atmos is\nclosely tied the ZeuS malware in the way it utilizes the same web injects that ZeuS was infamous\nfor. Recent strains, the security firm said, appear to be tied to configuration servers based in\nCanada, United States, Russia and Turkey. \n\nKjaersgaard said, at this early stage there is no one predictable attack vector or infection\nscenario for Atmos. Analysis of current strains of Atmos, he said, have spread via malware infected\nbanner ads, booby-trapped websites and via phishing attacks. \n\nOnce infected, Atmos will scrape data from its target computer or simply hide out and try to collect\nuser credentials. Phase two, he said, includes a ransomware attack. Atmos is an equal opportunity\nthreat, Kjaersgaard said. \u201cOnce Atmos attackers have stolen everything it can from your system they\nwill throw some ransomware (Teslacrypt) on the system in an attempt to steal more from you.\u201d \n\nHeimdal Security say Atmos is representative of a new breed of malware, one where the authors go to\ngreat pains to develop malware very precisely. \u201cThese guys are tired of throwing spaghetti at the\nwall and seeing what sticks. Now they are taking their time, performing quality assurance test,\nslowly ramping up production and then launching calculated attacks,\u201d Kjaersgaard said. \n\nHe said right now Atmos is at the early stages and predicts a wider more aggressive attack that\nlooks far beyond France and the banking industry. \n\n", "date": "2016-04-12T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/zeus-banking-trojan-resurfaces-as-atmos-variant/117344/", "subjectivity": 0.47242021544347124}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.06538628472222223, "author": "Vincent Liu", "title": "How \u0091Security Scorecards\u0092 Advance Security, Reduce Risk", "body": "Bishop Fox\u2019s Vincent Liu sat down recently with Josh Koplik, IAC chief information security officer,\nin a wide-ranging conversation about the all-too-common schism between business and security\nobjectives, his innovative security scorecard, and why strong security will never be a strategic\nmarketing asset for business. We excerpt highlights below. You can read the\u00a0full text here.\n\nFourth in a series of interviews with cybersecurity experts by cybersecurity experts.\n\nVincent Liu: Why do business and security people think differently about risk?\n\nJosh Koplik: Understanding what makes a system secure is easy because it\u2019s a technical problem.\nDeciding whether or not that\u2019s worth doing from a business standpoint is more complicated. A lot of\nsecurity people assume that security initiatives are always worth pursuing. If it takes zero\nresources \u2013 no time, no money, no anything \u2013 of course you\u2019d do it. Every security improvement comes\nwith a cost, and those costs are not always apparent or worth bearing.\n\nVL: What do you, as a security professional, wish business people understood?\n\nJK: I don\u2019t think a lot of business people consider the cost of security events. The impression is\nthat these breaches cost outrageous amounts of money, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Even in the\nmost high-profile examples, if you look at the breach costs as percentage of annual revenue or some\nmetric that takes into account the size of the target to begin with, it\u2019s not that bad.\u00a0I also think\nbreaches, in terms of real impact, get overstated as far as reputational impact is concerned.\n\nVL: Are there times when you as a security executive would consciously accept risk?\n\nJK: Security people would do well to accept risk, have a process for accepting risk, and make their\nbusiness colleagues comfortable with accepting risk or paying for mitigation.\n\nIf we have this business that is under-performing, it\u2019s easy to look at the balance sheet of that\nbusiness and know whether spending $100,000 on a pentest is worth doing. This is one place where\nCISOs can run into trouble.\n\nOnce you get to the point where you are no longer under a CIO, you\u2019re no longer part of a technology\norganization, and you\u2019re having regular conversations with your CFO, your CIO, with your heads of\nyour business lines, those conversations become easier. Your CFO may not understand stack overflows\nand intrusion prevention systems, but he knows numbers. So you can say, \u201cHere\u2019s a thing. On a scale\nof 1 to 10 in terms of importance, I give it a 7. And it costs $150,000.\u201d\n\nVL: Tell us about your security scorecard? Do you actually give out grades?\n\nJK:\u00a0I use people\u2019s inherent competitive nature in this situation. I issue grades, which makes people\nwork harder so they can beat the other guy.\n\nVL: What does it look like and how does it work?\n\nJK:\u00a0Basically, businesses are listed down the left side. Then, security domains are listed at the\ntop. In each little box, there is a letter grade and corresponding color code. Bs are green, Cs are\nyellow, Ds are red, and that\u2019s it! That\u2019s the scorecard.\n\nBehind the scenes, there\u2019s criteria; in other words, it\u2019s descriptive. To earn an A in vulnerability\nmanagement, you have to do this series of things. It\u2019s not long, you can read the criteria for the\nentire seven domains in fifteen minutes. The grade levels are slightly different-worded versions of\nthe same thing. Whereas a B might state \u201cmost,\u201d a C will state \u201csome.\u201d There is enough room for\ninterpretation that you can wiggle between grade levels, but not enough room that things look fake.\nIt\u2019s an A, B, C, D scale; there is no such thing as an A-. I have enough trouble differentiating\nbetween B and C as is. ABCD I can describe well.\n\nBecause it\u2019s simple, people at the executive level can understand it at a glance. You can easily\npresent this to a CEO. If a business wants to grow, they will want to do something about poor\ngrades. However, if you go to a struggling business with a bunch of Ds, they\u2019ll shrug and say, \u201cThat\nis the least of our problems. We don\u2019t have any revenue.\u201d\n\nVL: When I spoke to Rich Seiersen at GE Healthcare\u00a0he said that some things are unnecessary because\nthey don\u2019t progress the conversation. Instead, they end up wasting time and detracting value. What\nyou\u2019re really doing with these scorecards is trying to drive change or to start a conversation,\nisn\u2019t it?\n\nJK: Grades don\u2019t make you more secure; they need to reflect practices that you are doing that\nactually make you more secure. They define what those things are and whether or not they are being\ndone. You need to trace anything you are measuring back to on-the-ground activities that improve\nsecurity. If you can\u2019t, I question what you are measuring.\n\nVL: Are there downsides to your scorecard?

But one\nsalient point that\u2019s emerged from its ongoing dispute with the FBI over unlocking the San Bernardino\nshooter\u2019s phone is that Apple is a threat to itself. Therefore, it should be no surprise that Apple\nengineers are already reportedly working on iPhone security updates that\u00a0take into account Apple as\npart of its threat model. \n\nMeanwhile, the war of words between Apple and the FBI escalated again last night when CEO Tim Cook\nappeared on ABC News and likened the government\u2019s request to write new firmware that would bypass\nexisting security on the device as \u201cthe software equivalent of cancer.\u201d Cook reiterated that Apple\u2019s\ndefiant stance is about fending off the precedent that meeting such a demand would create. The\ngovernment would have at its disposal a mechanism for similarly unlocking devices in perpetuity not\njust for national security cases, but also for lesser-profile criminal cases. This is largely\nbecause Apple currently has the ability to update firmware without the need for the user to enter\ntheir passcode onto the phone. \n\nJonathan Zdziarski, a noted iOS forensics expert, told Threatpost that he expects Apple to close\nthis off in short order, as well as shore up the Secure Enclave, which protects newer versions of\nthe iPhone by brokering access to encryption keys for services on the device that require\nencryption. He believes Apple\u2019s threat model will include itself going forward. \n\n\u201cThey probably will shore up Secure Enclave so that it doesn\u2019t accept new firmware without being\nunlocked first. Minor tweaks to Secure Enclave should be enough to keep Apple out without going to\nextreme efforts to break in,\u201d Zdziarski said. \u201cOnce you get past being able to write and sign your\nown firmware, you have to get in with electron microscopes and look at the fuse array where the\nDevice ID encryption is based. You have to get to deep logic levels to the point where you\u2019re\nmessing with silicon.\u201d \n\nZdziarski wrote a post to his personal website on Wednesday describing 13 iOS security improvements\nApple should consider, among those would be a modification to the DFU, or Device Firmware Upgrade,\nthat it\u2019s destructive and drops the encryption keys before loading an image unless the phone has\nbeen unlocked by the user. He also advocates that Apple encrypt backup data sent to iCloud with keys\nderived from the user\u2019s alphanumeric backup password. \n\n\u201cThe iPhone (6) today, I think is reasonably secure the way it is. The only reason we are having\nthis conversation at all is that the subject was lax enough in their security practices to use a\nweak passcode,\u201d Zdziarski said in reference to suspect Syed Farook, whose four-digit numeric code\nguards the data on the iPhone 5c coveted by the FBI. Zdziarski points out that a six-character\nalphanumeric passcode would take years to crack with a modern computer, and an 11-character code\nmore than 100 years. \u201cThis is the classic encryption problem. The strength of the password is still\ngoing to determine the strength of the security on the device. Even if the FBI got Apple to remove\nall the security features from the device today, the key derivation alone will render that\nencryption infeasible to break if they had used a good passcode.\u201d \n\nThe FBI hopes to crack the device in order to learn whether Farood had any other contacts or\ninformation that could be useful in this investigation or others related to national security and\nterrorism. Last week, a federal magistrate ordered Apple to assist the FBI by writing new firmware\nthat would bypass security features such as the introduction of a significant and escalating time\nlag between incorrect guesses of the passcode, as well as the wiping of the device after 10\nincorrect tries. The FBI hopes to compel Apple to write new firmware that would also allow them to\nuse a computer to generate guesses and brute-force the device. While the FBI and the court insists\nthis is a one-time request, Apple attorney Marc Zwillinger two days ago unsealed a document sent to\nthe court that revealed a dozen similar requests made to Apple by the government in cases of varying\nseverity. Apple has objected to 10 of those requests\u2014made since October\u2014and is awaiting more\ndocumentation in two other requests. \n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s bad news to write (the new firmware). We would never write it. We have never written\nit,\u201d Cook said, acknowledging the complexity and emotions involved. \u201cIt is about the future. Think\nabout this: If a court compels Apple to write this piece of software, to place a backdoor in the\niPhone, we believe it does put hundreds of millions of customers at risk.\u201d \n\nZdziarski said he believes Apple would bring this to the Supreme Court if need be, and that Congress\nshould intervene at some point given that the American people have not been represented in this\ndebate to date. \n\n\u201cThis is high profile enough that at some point, the heat of it all this is going to back the FBI\noff this, or it will get taken as high up as it can go and we\u2019ll see some kind of decision based on\nthat,\u201d he said. \n\nApple was given five days to respond to the court order, and that runs out tomorrow. \n\n\u201cThis is not a position that we would like to be in, it is a very uncomfortable position,\u201d Cook\nsaid. \u201cTo oppose your government on something doesn\u2019t feel good. And to oppose it on something where\nwe are advocating for civil liberties which they are supposed to protect it is incredibly ironic.\u201d \n\n", "date": "2016-02-25T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-must-forever-threat-model-against-itself/116473/", "subjectivity": 0.4881833109419315}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.04773049645390073, "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Zeus Variant \u2018Floki Bot\u2019 Targets PoS Data", "body": "Researchers have observed an uptick in attacks using the banking malware Floki Bot against U.S.,\nCanadian and Brazilian banks, and insurance firms. \n\nFloki Bot, which uses code from the once notorious Zeus banking Trojan, has evolved and unlike its\npredecessor, is targeting point-of-sale\u00a0systems via aggressive spear phishing campaigns and the RIG\nexploit kit. \n\nCisco Talos and Flashpoint security researchers coordinated the release of reports on Floki Bot on\nWednesday. Both firms warn\u00a0the malware\u00a0is quickly gaining popularity within Dark Web criminal\nforums. \n\n\u201cFloki Bot is currently being actively bought and sold on several darknet markets,\u201d wrote Cisco\nTalos in its report released Wednesday. \u201cIt will likely continue to be seen in the wild as\ncybercriminals continue to attempt to leverage it to attack systems in an aim to monetize their\nefforts.\u201d \n\nThis most recent version of Floki Bot, spotted in September, is based on the Zeus 2.0.8.9 source\ncode released in 2011. There have been several incarnations of Floki Bot since then, however this\nmost recent version is being developed, marketed and sold by a shrewd hacker that goes by the same\nname as the malware. \n\n\u201cThis actor is remarkable for a number of reasons, in particular their presence in a number of top-\ntier underground communities across a range of languages (Portuguese, English and Russian),\u201d wrote\nVitali Kremez, senior intelligence analyst at Flashpoint in a report also released Wednesday. Kremez\nbelieves Flokibot\u2019s\u00a0native language is Portuguese and that the hacker is based in Brazil. \n\nTypical infections stem from spear phishing attacks where victims are enticed to enable malicious\nmacros in Microsoft\u00a0Word documents sent as email attachments. Once enabled, the macro retrieves the\nFloki Bot malware, according to Kremez. \n\n\u201cOnce the malware is executed, it attempts to inject malicious code into \u2018explorer.exe\u2019 \u2013 the\nMicrosoft Windows file manager,\u201d according to Talos\u2019\u00a0technical analysis of the inject sequence of\nthe Floki Bot malware code. \u201cIf it is unable to open \u2018explorer.exe\u2019, it will then inject into\n\u2018svchost.exe\u2019.\u201d \n\nThe injection is a PE file (bot32). \u201cThe sample we analyzed is hardcoded to only pass the address of\nthe \u2018bot32\u2019 resource to the injected payload,\u201d Cisco Talos wrote. \u201cAt every stage, the malware uses\nhashing to obfuscate module and function names used in dynamic library resolution.\u201d \n\nAccording to Flashpoint researchers Floki Bot differs significantly from the Zeus that was\ndistributed in mass spam campaigns. Zeus also did not include PoS scraping functionality and was\nabsent of any antivirus obfuscation techniques discovered in Floki Bot in November. \n\n\u201cWhile the malware originates from the well-known Zeus 2.0.8.9 source code, Floki Bot adds a hooking\nmethod to grab track data from memory thereby extending the malware operations beyond regular\nbanking Trojan functionality, making it more potent and versatile,\u201d Kremez wrote. \n\nOther distinctions between Floki Bot and Zeus include Floki Bot availability\u00a0on the Dark Web selling\nfor $1,000. The Zeus variant called GameOver, on the other hand, was only distributed to a close\ncircle of criminal gangs and sold for $15,000 in its prime, Kremez said. \n\n\u201cFloki Bot is currently being used by 10\u00a0cyber-criminal gangs,\u201d Kremez said. \u201cGameOver Zeus, in its\nheyday, was used by only five exclusive gangs.\u201d \n\nIn 2007, Zeus malware earned notoriety for compromising nearly 75,000 websites owned by the likes of\nABC, Bank of America and Oracle. In 2013, the Zeus code was used to construct Citadel malware, known\nfor its cunning ability to steal personal, banking and financial information. Denmark-based Heimdal\nSecurity reported in April that Zeus code had been re-purposed to create the variant Atmos malware,\nwhich went on to target banks in France. Atmos\u00a0can either scrape data from its target computer or\nsimply hide out and collect user credentials. \n\nAnother interesting distinction between ZeuS and Floki Bot is the presence of Tor network support in\nthe source code. Talos says the Tor support code is non-functional and \u201cappears to be under\ndevelopment and could not be activated in the samples.\u201d \n\nBoth Cisco and Flashpoint warn that those behind Floki Bot have worked hard to lower the technical\nbar needed for cyber criminals to use the tool. \n\n\u201cThe time required to attain a high level of skill and sophistication has been continuously reduced.\n\u00a0As criminals share information to defeat protections, we should be sharing it as well with our\ncommunity to defeat threats,\u201d Flashpoint wrote. \n\n", "date": "2016-12-07T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/zeus-variant-floki-bot-targets-pos-data/122310/", "subjectivity": 0.4322496298028212}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.036666666666666674, "author": "Brian Donohue", "title": "Virginia Voting Machines Exposed to Simple, Potentially Election-Altering Hacks Since 2004", "body": "The Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) is calling on the board of elections in that\ncommonwealth to immediately discontinue use of its electronic voting devices after an examination\nrevealed the systems lack strong credentials and encryption and are utterly vulnerable to vote\nmanipulation. \n\nThe vulnerable devices are identified as \u201cAdvanced Voting System WINVote.\u201d The machines have been in\nuse since 2002. Threatpost contacted the Virginia Board of Elections to inquire how widely adopted\nthese systems are in the commonwealth, but they did not provide that information before the time of\npublication. The Virginia Board of Elections has decertified the WINVote machines. \n\n\u201cThe Board and the Department took immediate action to address the serious security concerns\nidentified with this equipment and to protect Virginia\u2019s electoral system from potential significant\nproblems in the future,\u201d said Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cort\u00e9s in a statement.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision to decertify WINVote voting equipment showed a bipartisan commitment to ensuring\nthe integrity of elections in the Commonwealth.\u201d \n\nIn general, the report indicates that the level of sophistication required to perform attacks on the\nWINVote election systems was low. In fact, Jeremy Epstein of Freedom to Tinker explains that\nexploiting the WINVote system is trivial from the parking lot of a polling place (i.e. within Wi-Fi\nrange) or from as far as a half-mile away. \n\n\u201cIf an election was held using the AVS WinVote, and it wasn\u2019t hacked, it was only because no one\ntried. The vulnerabilities were so severe, and so trivial to exploit, that anyone with even a\nmodicum of training could have succeeded. They didn\u2019t need to be in the polling place \u2013 within a few\nhundred feet (e.g., in the parking lot) is easy, and within a half mile with a rudimentary antenna\nbuilt using a Pringles can. Further, there are no logs or other records that would indicate if such\na thing ever happened, so if an election was hacked any time in the past, we will never know,\u201d\nEpstein wrote. \n\nBeyond weak passwords and easily breakable encryption, auditors also found security deficiencies in\nphysical controls, network access, operating system controls and even the vote tallying process.\nVITA notes that these critical security vulnerabilities, along with \u201cthe ability to remotely modify\nvotes discretely,\u201d pose substantial risk to voting integrity in the commonwealth. \n\n\u201cThis heightened level of risk has led VITA security staff to conclude that malicious third party\ncould be able to alter votes on these devices,\u201d VITA concluded in its report. \u201cThese machines should\nnot remain in service.\u201d \n\nThe board of elections has since decertified the WINVote machines. \n\nAs their name suggests, the devices run on the Windows operating system. Unfortunately, the\nparticular variant is Windows XP Embedded 2002, which, depending on the service pack, may or may not\nbe supported and may or may not receive security updates. VITA claims the systems are supported\nuntil Jan. 12, 2016, a claim that is validated by one Microsoft lifecycle and support schedule.\nHowever, another of Microsoft\u2019s lifecycle fact sheets notes that the first service pack of XP\nEmbedded 2002 received its last update on April 10, 2007. If it\u2019s the second service pack, then the\nfinal patches would have been applied on January 11, 2011. \n\nIn either case, VITA found the devices exposed to a remote execution vulnerability resolved by a\npatch first released in 2004. Regardless of the operating systems support sunset date, these\nparticular machines have gone without security updates for at least 11 years. \n\nVoting data is stored in an unencrypted format. It took VITA auditors 10 seconds to brute-force the\npassword protecting these data (\u201cshoup\u201d). To be very clear, VITA was able to remotely modify and\nchange the results of a mock election performed under official conditions. There was no system\nintegrity check to determine whether\u00a0such manipulations had taken place. \n\nPhysically, the voting machines contained easily accessible USB ports through which a malicious\nthird party could access the machine locally. VITA also accessed the device BIOS, manipulated the\nboot order, plugged a detachable CD drive into one of the USB ports, compelled the machine to boot a\nseparate operating system (Knoppix) and took pictures of the drives. VITA believed it would be easy\nto install malware on the voting machines. \n\nAlso of concern is that ability to access the machines wirelessly, providing an attack vector\nthrough which an attacker could modify device data from nearby. This problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that the machines broadcast their Wi-Fi network and deploy weak WEP cryptographic protection.\nThe auditors managed to break the WEP encryption, steal the keys and, adding insult to injury,\ndetermine that the network was protected by the password \u201cabcde\u201d. With this password, an attacker\ncould easily view and modify voting and vote tallying information in real time. \n\nThe WINVote application allows administrators to disable Wi-Fi. However, the devices still transmit\nwireless signals even when they are disabled inside the application. In other words, there is no way\nto disable wireless access without rendering the machines useless. \n\nA brute-force tool very quickly determined that the administrative interfaces were protected by the\npassword \u201cadmin\u201d, which allowed full access to the WINVote operating system. \n\nVITA tested 10 Advanced Voting Systems WINVote devices with default configurations. VITA was not\ngiven any advance information about existing security controls implemented on the devices, and the\nagency used common exploit techniques to attack them. Ultimately, the goal was to determine if the\ndevices were sufficiently secure against vote manipulation. \n\n", "date": "2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/virginia-voting-machines-exposed-to-simple-potentially-election-altering-hacks-since-2004/112297/", "subjectivity": 0.4738821630347054}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.1386938061938062, "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Wekby APT Gang Using DNS Tunneling for Command and Control", "body": "Palo Alto Networks is reporting a shift in malware tactics used by the APT group Wekby that has\nadded a rare but effective new tool to its bag of tricks. The security firm reported on Tuesday that\nover the past week, Wekby attackers are turning to the technique known as DNS tunneling in lieu of\nmore conventional HTTP delivery of command and controls for remote access control of infected\ncomputer networks. \n\nResearchers discovered the change in strategy while monitoring an undisclosed U.S.-based high-tech\nfirm targeted by the gang. Palo Alto Networks call the DNS tunneling malware pisloader, adding it\nhas existed for some time but is seldom used. The use of the DNS-based attacks differs from the\nWekby\u2019s go-to malware HTTPBrowser, which is still used widely by the group, according to Ryan Olson,\nresearcher at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 team. \n\n\u201cWe found it really interesting that this pisloader malware technique not only was being used to\nexfiltration data but also as a command and control mechanism,\u201d Olson told Threatpost. The malware\nis uncommon because of its limited use case for attacks and that it requires above average technical\nsophistication by the perpetrator to configure. Domains used in the Wekby attack outlined by Palo\nAlto Networks include globalprint-us[.]com, ns1.logitech-usa[.]com and intranetwabcam[.]com. \n\nDNS tunneling takes advantage of the TXT transport layer within the DNS protocol used by top and\nsecond level domain name system servers. A maximum of 255 bytes of data can be transported via DNS\nrequest between endpoint and a DNS server using the TXT layer. For Wekby attackers that have already\ngained a foothold on targeted systems, the DNS tunneling of commands and DNS tunneling used to\nremove of data is extremely slow, but well suited for long term APT campaigns. \n\nIn the case of pisloader, attackers would use their own DNS server that they controlled to send and\nreceive C2 commands to infected computers. Embedded in the DNS TXT layer of the call and responses\nbetween infected client and Wekby\u2019s DNS server would be a mix of five instructions including;\ncollect victim system information, list drives on victim machine, list file information for provided\ndirectory, upload a file to the victim machine, and spawn a command shell. \n\nTo obfuscate those commands, Wekby attackers use base32 encoding on the DNS TXT layer making it\nappear that the DNS TXT was simply garbage strings of DNS metadata. \n\nFor attackers, DNS tunneling is a double-edged sword, Olson said. \u201cPisloader is extremely hard to\ndiscover if you\u2019re not already looking for it. But with a limit of 255 bytes per message uploading\nanything could take days to weeks without sounding alarms,\u201d he said. But because pisloader was able\nto skirt many security products that don\u2019t inspect DNS traffic properly, attackers are willing to\nsacrifice speed for stealth, Olson said. For those reasons the use of pisloader is extremely rare,\neven among Wekby gangs. In fact, the use of DNS as a C2 protocol has never been widely adopted by\nAPT gangs. Olson said, there are very few malware families with similar DNS tunneling attributes\nsuch a FrameworkPOS, C3PRO-RACCOON and FeederBot. \n\nPalo Alto Networks said it was able to link the pisloader malware to Wekby because it shared many\nsimilar characteristics found within the HTTPBrowser RAT family \u2013 commonly used by Wekby. Palo Alto\nNetworks said the Wekby APT group remains active, targeting many U.S.-based healthcare,\ntelecommunications, aerospace, defense, and high-tech companies. \n\n\u201cThe group is known to leverage recently released exploits very shortly after those exploits are\navailable, such as in the case of HackingTeam\u2019s Flash zero-day exploit,\u201d according to Palo Alto\nNetworks report on the pisloader. Palo Alto Networks has said that Wekby has often leveraged the\nzero-day Adobe Flash Exploit (CVE-2015-5119) via spear phishing campaigns. That said, Olson told\nThreatpost researchers couldn\u2019t be sure of the exploit used to gain a foothold in the high-tech firm\ntargeted by Wekby attackers. \n\n", "date": "2016-05-25T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/wekby-apt-gang-using-dns-tunneling-for-command-and-control/118303/", "subjectivity": 0.4906200743700743}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.10634235665881238, "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Location Privacy: The Purview of the Rich and Indigent", "body": "I\u2019d just finished parking my car in the covered garage at Reagan National Airport just across the\nriver from Washington, D.C. when I noticed a dark green minivan slowly creeping through the row\nbehind me. The vehicle caught my attention because its driver didn\u2019t appear to be looking for an\nopen spot. What\u2019s more, the van had what looked like two cameras perched atop its roof \u2014 one of each\nside, both pointed down and slightly off to the side.\n\nI had a few hours before my flight boarded, so\u00a0I delayed my walk to the terminal and cut through\nseveral rows of cars to snag a video of the guy moving haltingly through another line of cars. I\napproached the driver and asked what he was doing. He smiled and tilted the lid on his bolted-down\nlaptop so that I could see the pictures he was taking with the mounted cameras: He was photographing\nevery license plate in the garage (for the record, his plate was a Virginia tag number 36-646L).\n\nThe man said he was hired\u00a0by the airport to keep track of the precise location of every car in the\nlot, explaining that the data is most often used by the airport when passengers returning from a\ntrip forget where they parked their vehicles. I checked with the Metropolitan Washington Airports\nAuthority (MWAA), which manages the garage, and they confirmed the license plate imaging service was\nhandled by a third-party firm called HUB Parking.\n\nI\u2019m accustomed to having my license plate photographed when entering a parking area (Dulles\nInternational Airport in Virginia does this), but until that encounter at Reagan National I\u00a0never\nconsidered that this was done manually.\n\n\u201cReagan National uses this service to assist customers in finding their lost vehicles,\u201d said MWAA\nspokesperson Kimberly Gibbs. \u201cIf the customer remembers their license plate it can be entered into\nthe system to determine what garages and on what aisle their vehicle is parked.\u201d\n\nWhat does HUB Parking do with the information its clients collect? Ilaria Riva, marketing manager\nfor HUB Parking, says the company does not sell or share the data it collects, and that it is up to\nthe client to decide how that information is stored or shared.\n\n\u201cIt is true the solution that HUB provides to our clients may collect data, but HUB does not own the\ndata nor do we have any control over what the customer does with it,\u201d Riva said.\n\nGibbs said MWAA does not share parking information with outside organizations. But make no mistake:\nthe technology used at Reagan National Airport, known as automated license plate reader or ALPR\nsystems, is already widely deployed by municipalities, police forces and private companies \u2014\nparticularly those in the business of repossessing vehicles from deadbeat owners who don\u2019t pay their\nbills.\n\nIt\u2019s true that people have zero\u00a0expectation of privacy in public places \u2014 and roads and parking\ngarages certainly are public places for the most part. But according to the Electronic Frontier\nFoundation (EFF), the data collected by ALPR systems\u00a0can be very revealing, and in many cities ALPR\ntechnology is rapidly outpacing the law.\n\n\u201cBy matching your car to a particular time, date and location, and then building a database of that\ninformation over time, law enforcement can learn where you work and live, what doctor you go to,\nwhich religious services you attend, and who your friends are,\u201d the EFF warns.\n\nA 2014 ABC News investigation in Los Angeles found the technology broadly in use by everyone from\nthe local police to repo men. The story notes that there are little or no restrictions on what\nprivate companies that collect time- and location-stamped license plate data can do with the\ninformation. As a result, they are selling it to insurers, banks, law enforcement and federal\nagencies.\n\nIn Texas, the EFF highlights how state and local law enforcement agencies have free access to ALPR\nequipment and license plate data maintained by a private company called Vigilant Solutions. In\nexchange, police cruisers are retrofitted with credit-card machines so that law enforcement officers\ncan take payments for delinquent fines and other charges on the spot \u2014 with a 25 percent processing\nfee tacked on that goes straight to Vigilant. In essence,\u00a0the driver is paying Vigilant to provide\nthe local cops with the technology used to identify and detain the driver.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018warrant redemption\u2019 program works like this,\u201d the EFF wrote. \u201cThe agency is given no-cost\nlicense plate readers as well as free access to LEARN-NVLS, the ALPR data system Vigilant says\ncontains more than 2.8-billion plate scans and is growing by more than 70-million scans a month.\nThis also includes a wide variety of analytical and predictive software tools. Also, the agency is\nmerely licensing the technology; Vigilant can take it back at any time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right: Even if the contract between the state and Vigilant ends, the latter gets to keep all\nof the license plate data collected by the agency, and potentially sell or license the information\nto other governments or use it for other purposes.\n\nI wanted to write this story not because it\u2019s particularly newsy, but because I was curious about a\nsingle event and ended up learning a great deal that I didn\u2019t already know about how pervasive this\ntechnology has become.\n\nYes, we need more transparency about what companies and governments are doing with information\ncollected in public. But here\u2019s the naked truth: None of us should harbor any illusions about\nmaintaining the privacy of our location at any given moment \u2014 particularly in public spaces.\n\nAs it happens, location privacy is a considerably expensive and difficult goal for most Americans to\nattain and maintain. Our mobile phones are constantly pinging cell towers, making it simple for\nmobile providers and law enforcement agencies to get a fix on your location within a few dozen\nmeters.\n\nObscuring the address of your residence is even harder. If you\u2019ve ever had a mortgage on your home\nor secured utilities for your residence using your own name, chances are excellent that your name\nand address are in thousands of databases, and can be found with a free or inexpensive public\nrecords search online.\n\nIncreasingly, location privacy is the exclusive purview of two groups of Americans: Those who are\nindigent and/or homeless and those who are wealthy. Only the well-off can afford the substantial\ncosts and many petty inconveniences associated with separating one\u2019s name from their address,\nvehicle, phone records and other modern niceties that make one easy to track and find.\n\n", "date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/location-privacy-the-purview-of-the-rich-and-indigent/", "subjectivity": 0.4395142656218606}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": -0.056679894179894184, "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "FBI Raids Spammer Outed by KrebsOnSecurity", "body": "Michael A. Persaud, a California man profiled in a Nov. 2014 KrebsOnSecurity story about a junk\nemail artist currently flagged\u00a0by anti-spam activists as\u00a0one of the world\u2019s\u00a0Top 10 Worst Spammers,\nwas reportedly\u00a0raided by the\u00a0FBI in connection with a federal spam investigation.\n\nAccording to a June 9 story at ABC News, on April 27, 2016 the FBI raided the San Diego home of\nPersaud, who reportedly has\u00a0been under federal investigation since at least 2013. The story noted\nthat on June 6, 2016, the FBI asked for and was granted a warrant to search Persaud\u2019s iCloud\naccount, which investigators believe contained \u201cevidence of illegal spamming\u2019 and wire fraud to\nfurther [Persaud\u2019s] spamming activities.\u201d\n\nPersaud\u00a0doesn\u2019t appear to have been charged with a crime in connection with this investigation. He\nmaintains his email marketing business is legitimate and complies with the CAN-SPAM Act, the main\nanti-spam law in the United States which prohibits the sending of spam that spoofs that sender\u2019s\naddress or does not give recipients an easy way to opt out of receiving future such emails from that\nsender.\n\nThe affidavit that investigators with the FBI used to get a warrant for Persaud\u2019s iCloud account is\nsealed, but a copy of it was obtained by KrebsOnSecurity. It shows that during the April 2016 FBI\nsearch of his home, Persaud told agents\u00a0that he\u00a0currently conducts internet marketing from his\nresidence by sending a million emails in under 15 minutes from various domains and Internet\naddresses.\n\nThe affidavit indicates the FBI was very interested in the email address michaelp77x@gmail.com. In\nmy 2014 piece Still Spamming After All These Years, I called attention to this address as the one\ntied to Persaud\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 and to 5,000 or so domains he was advertising in spam. The\nstory was about how the junk email Persaud acknowledged sending was being relayed through broad\nswaths of Internet address space that had been hijacked from hosting firms and other companies.\n\nFBI Special Agent Timothy J. Wilkins wrote that investigators also subpoenaed and got access to that\nmichaelp77x@gmail.com account, and found emails between Persaud and at least four affiliate programs\nthat hire spammers to send junk email campaigns.\n\nA spam affiliate program is a type of business or online retailer \u2014 such as an Internet pharmacy \u2014\nthat pays a third party (known as affiliates or spammers) a percentage of any sales that they\ngenerate for the program (for a much deeper dive on how affiliate programs work, check out Spam\nNation).\n\nWhen I wrote about Persaud back in 2014, I noted that his spam generally advertised the\u00a0types of\nbusinesses you might expect to see pimped in junk email: payday loans, debt consolidation services,\nand various \u201cnutraceutical\u201d products.\n\nPersaud did not respond to requests for comment. But in an email he sent to KrebsOnSecurity in\nNovember 2014, he said:\n\nPersaud is currently listed as #10 on the World\u2019s 10 Worst Spammers list maintained by Spamhaus, an\nanti-spam organization.\u00a0In 1998, Persaud was sued by AOL, which charged that\u00a0he committed fraud by\nusing various names to send millions of get-rich-quick spam messages to America Online customers. In\n2001, the San Diego District Attorney\u2019s office filed criminal charges against Persaud, alleging that\nhe and an accomplice crashed a company\u2019s email server after routing their spam through the company\u2019s\nservers.\n\n", "date": "2016-06-16T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/06/fbi-raids-spammer-outed-by-krebsonsecurity/", "subjectivity": 0.4611331569664903}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.02624673498091219, "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Hacked Via RDP: Really Dumb Passwords", "body": "Businesses spend billions of dollars annually on software and hardware to block external\ncyberattacks, but a shocking number of these same organizations shoot themselves in the foot by\npoking gaping holes in their digital defenses and then advertising those vulnerabilities to\nattackers. Today\u2019s post examines an underground service that rents access to hacked PCs at\norganizations that make this all-too-common mistake.\n\nMakost[dot]net is a service advertised on cybercrime forums which sells access to \u201cRDPs\u201d, mainly\nMicrosoft Windows systems that have been configured (poorly) to accept \u201cRemote Desktop Protocol\u201d\nconnections from the Internet. Windows ships with its own RDP interface built-in; to connect to\nanother Windows desktop or server remotely, simply fire up the Remote Desktop Connection utility in\nWindows, type in the Internet address of the remote system, and enter the correct username and\npassword for a valid user account on that remote system. Once the connection is made, you\u2019ll see the\nremote computer\u2019s desktop as if you were sitting right in front of it, and have access to all its\nprograms and files.\n\nMakost currently is selling access to more than 6,000 compromised RDP installations worldwide. As we\ncan see from the screen shot above, hacked systems are priced according to a combination of\nqualities of the server:\n\nKrebsOnSecurity was given a glimpse inside the account of a very active user of this service, an\nindividual who has paid more than $2,000 over the past six months to purchase some 425 hacked RDPs.\nI took the Internet addresses in this customer\u2019s purchase history and ran WHOIS database lookups on\nthem all in a bid to learn more about the victim organizations. As expected, roughly three-quarters\nof those addresses told me nothing about the victims; the addresses were assigned to residential or\ncommercial Internet service providers.\n\nBut the WHOIS records turned up the names of businesses for approximately 25 percent of the\naddresses I looked up. The largest group of organizations on this list were in the manufacturing (21\nvictims) and retail services (20) industries.\u00a0As I sought to categorize the long tail of other\nvictim organizations, I was reminded of the Twelve Days of Christmas carol.\n\ntwelve healthcare providers; ten education providers; eight government agencies; seven technology\nfirms; six insurance companies; five law firms; four financial institutions; three architects; two\nreal estate firms; and a forestry company (in a pear tree?)\n\nHow did these companies end up for sale on makost[dot]net? That is explained deftly in a report\nproduced earlier this year by\u00a0Trustwave, a company which frequently gets called in when companies\nexperience a data breach that exposes credit card information. Trustwave looked at all of the\nbreaches it responded to in 2012 and found \u2014 just as in years past \u2014 \u201cIP remote access remained the\nmost widely used method of infiltration in 2012. Unfortunately for victim organizations, the front\ndoor is still open.\u201d\n\nThe report continues:\n\n\u201cOrganizations that use third-party support typically use remote access applications like Terminal\nServices (termserv) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), pcAnywhere, Virtual Network Client (VNC),\nLogMeIn or Remote Administrator to access their customers\u2019 systems. If these utilities are left\nenabled, attackers can access them as though they are legitimate system administrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould-be attackers simply scan blocks of Internet addresses looking for hosts that respond to\nqueries on one of these ports. Once they have a focused target list of Internet addresses with open\nremote administration ports, they can move on to the next part of the attack: The number 2 most-\nexploited weakness: deafult/weak credentials.\u201d\n\nIn case the point wasn\u2019t clear enough yet, I\u2019ve gathered all of the username and password pairs\npicked by all 430 RDP-enabled systems that were sold to this miscreant. As evidenced by the list\nbelow, the attackers simply needed to scan the Internet for hosts listening on port 3389 (Microsoft\nRDP), identify valid usernames, and then try the same username as the password. In each of the\nfollowing cases, the username and password are the same.\n\nSome of these credential pairs even give you an idea of the type of organization involved, the\nemployee account that was compromised (\u201cintern,\u201d \u201ctechsupport,\u201d);\u00a0the purpose of the hacked system\n(\u201cpayroll\u201d, \u201cfax,\u201d \u201cscanner,\u201d \u201ctimeclock\u201d); even the geographic location of the compromised PC\nwithin the organization (e.g., \u201cfront desk,\u201d \u201cconference room,\u201d \u201cgarage\u201d). Incredibly, some of the\nsystems appear to be named after actual security features or backup devices (\u201csymantec,\u201d\n\u201csonicwall,\u201d \u201csophos\u201d):\n\nowner owner showroom

read this far, I hope it\u2019s clear by now that the easiest way to get your systems hacked\nusing RDP is to pick crappy credentials. Unfortunately, far too many organizations that end up for\nsale on services like this one are there because they outsourced their tech support to some third-\nparty company that engages in this sort of sloppy security. Fortunately, a quick external port scan\nof your organization\u2019s Internet address ranges should tell you if any RDP-equipped systems are\nenabled.

Unfortunately, that call created more questions than it did answers, at least\nfor me. The purpose of this post is to provide some information that I have gathered, and a few\nobservations about the reporting on this breach so far.\n\nIn a conference call this morning, Paul Garcia,\u00a0Chairman and CEO of Global Payments (NYSE: GPN),\ndeclined to offer few new details about how the breach happened, beyond the details the company\nreleased in its press release last night. He also declined to comment on reports that the breach may\nhave dated back to at least January 2012. Garcia emphasized that the company self-reported and\ndiscovered the intrusion in early March, and proactively notified law enforcement officials and\nhired independent forensics investigators.\n\nWhen asked about the timeline first reported by KrebsOnSecurity.com last Friday \u2014 that Visa and\nMasterCard were warning of a payment processor that had an exposure between Jan 21, 2012 and Feb.\n25, 2012 \u2014 Garcia said, without elaborating:\n\nHe went on to state that, \u201cThis does not involve our merchants, our sales partners, or their\nrelationships with their customers. Neither merchant systems, or point of sale devices, were\ninvolved in any way. This was self-discovered and self-reported.\u201d Databreaches.net has a decent\nround-up of the call details, as well as other reporting on this breach. A recording of the\nconference call is available here.\n\nI\u2019d like to share a few thoughts on my own reporting as it relates to this breach. First, when I\npublished the story early last Friday morning that is widely credited as the first to break the news\nof a large processor breach, at that time I did not know for sure that Global Payments had been\ncompromised. I\u2019d heard it from one source, but could not get it from a second source. The old-school\nreporter in me held back those details from my story.\n\nSeveral readers have called me irresponsible for quoting anonymous sources stating that the Global\nPayments breach may have affected more than 10 million cards. This is simply not true. I didn\u2019t even\nmention Global Payments in my original piece. That information was dug up by reporters at The Wall\nStreet Journal. Indeed, given GPN\u2019s statements thus far, I continue to be nagged by the possibility\nthat my initial reporting may have been related to a separate, as-yet undisclosed breach at another\nprocessor. I mentioned this to a reporter at ABC News today, who included my perspective in a story\nhere.\n\nRUMOR AND INNUENDO\n\nGPN said it would allow an hour for the call and for questions, but it told callers at the beginning\nof the conference that it would be using a portion of the call time to talk about its 4th quarter\nearnings. Although I sat in on the GPN call this morning for the entire hour and waited in the queue\nto ask questions, I was not afforded the opportunity. Nor did I hear questions allowed from\nreporters at mainstream news media outlets cited in this story. The company has not yet responded to\nmy questions, which I submitted in a phone call after the news conference.\n\nWhat follows is a partial brain dump on some of the information and interesting tidbits I\u2019ve been\nable to uncover in my reporting today, in no particular order. Some or all of them may turn out to\nbe relevant to the Global Payments breach, to a separate incident, or not at all.\n\n-For the past two years, GlobalPaymentsInc.com has been hosted at MaximumASP, a hosting provider in\nLouisville, KY. On Feb. 20, 2012, the company moved its Web site to Amazon\u2019s EC2 cloud hosting\nservice. MaximumASP declined to answer questions about possible reasons for the switch, citing\ncustomer confidentiality policies.\n\n-A source shared with me the following diagram, which provides a bit more perspective on how these\nbreaches are typically viewed by Visa, MasterCard and card processors. Note that the period of\ncompromised transactions is also sometimes called the \u201cwindow of vulnerable transactions.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s\nalso important to note that that discovery of the breach may or may not happen after the start date\nof the breach.\n\n-The New York Times in a story published Saturday cited unnamed sources saying that this was the\nsecond time in a year that Global Payments had experienced a breach. I have heard likewise from an\nanonymous hacker who claims the company was breached just after the new year in 2011.\u00a0 The hacker\nsaid the company\u2019s network was under full criminal control from that time until March 26, 2012. \u201cThe\ndata and quantities that was gathered [was] much more than they writed [sic]. They finished End2End\nencryption, but E2E not a full solution; it only defend [sic] from outside threats.\u201d He went on to\nclaim that hackers had been capturing data from the company\u2019s network for the past 13 months \u2014\ncollecting the data monthly \u2014 gathering data on a total of 24 million unique transactions before\nthey were shut out.\n\nWhen asked if he had evidence that would back up his claims, the hacker produced a Microsoft Word\ndocument with Global Payments\u2019s logo entitled \u201cDisaster Recovery Plan TDS US: Loss of the Atlanta\nData Center.\u201d The document appears to have been created on May 6, 2010 by Raj Thiruvengadam, who\naccording to LinkedIn.com was an Atlanta-based Oracle database administrator for Global Payments\nfrom May 2006 through August 2011.\n\nI asked Global Payments if they could verify the authenticity of the document, but have not yet\nheard back from them. I will not publish it, as it contains apparently sensitive information about\nthe organization\u2019s internal databases. A screen shot of the title page is below.\n\nMore to come as information is available.\n\n", "date": "2012-04-02T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/global-payments-rumor-and-innuendo/", "subjectivity": 0.3763429959632491}, {"_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "polarity": 0.0565018315018315, "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "DHS Blasts Reports of Illinois Water Station Hack", "body": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security today took aim at widespread media reports about a hacking\nincident that led to an equipment failure at a water system in Illinois, noting there was scant\nevidence to support any of the key details in those stories \u2014 including involvement by Russian\nhackers or that the outage at the facility was the result of a cyber incident.\n\nLast week, portions of a report titled \u201cPublic Water District Cyber Intrusion\u201d assembled by an\nIllinois terrorism early warning center were published online. Media outlets quickly picked up on\nthe described incident, calling it the \u201cfirst successful target of a cyber attack on a computer of a\npublic utility.\u201d But in an email dispatch sent to state, local and industry officials late today,\nDHS\u2019s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) said that after detailed\nanalysis, DHS and the FBI \u201chave found no evidence of a cyber intrusion into the SCADA system of the\nCurran-Gardner Public Water District in Springfield, Illinois.\u201d The ICS-CERT continued:\n\nThe statement is the most strongly worded yet from DHS refuting the alleged cyber incident in\nIllinois. The story broke on Nov. 17, when Joe Weiss, managing partner of Applied Control Solutions,\na security consultant for the control systems industry, published a blog post about a disclosure he\nreported reading from a state terrorism intelligence center about a cyber intrusion into a local\nwater plant that resulted in the burnout of a water pump. The break-in reportedly allowed intruders\nto manipulate the supervisory control and data acquisition system, or \u201cSCADA\u201d networks that let\nplant operators manage portions of the facility remotely over the Internet. Within hours of that\npost, media outlets covering the story had zeroed in on the Curran-Gardner Water District as the\nsource of the report.\n\nWeiss has repeatedly declined to share or publish the report, but he cited large portions of it in\nmy story from last week. The language and details reported in it stand in stark contrast to the\nDHS\u2019s version of events. According to Weiss, the report, marked sensitive but unclassified, stated:\n\nWeiss blogged about the ICS-CERT statement, and said he can\u2019t figure out how the two accounts could\nbe so different. He notes that the day after his blog post, Don Craven, chairman of the Curran-\nGardner Water District, was quoted on a local ABC News affiliate television interview saying that\nthere was \u201csome indication that there was a breach of some sort into a software program, a SCADA\nsystem, that allows remote access to the wells and the pumps and those sorts of things\u201d (see video\nbelow).\n\n\u201cThe real thing that bothers me is how could there be such substantial amount of information\nprovided where a lot of it is really a simple yes or no situation,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWas there a Russian\n[Internet] address involved or wasn\u2019t there? The Illinois facility also said their technician had\nobserved these abnormalities for 2-3 months. Well, either he did or he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe ICS-CERT communique also mentioned another alleged hacking incident of a water facility in Texas\nthat was widely reported last week. In that incident, a hacker using the nickname \u201cpr0f\u201d claimed to\nhave gained access to a water control systems plant, and posted a series of screen shots to prove\nhis accomplishment.\n\nRegarding the alleged hack in Texas, the ICS-CERT would only say it is still investigating:\n\n\u201cIn a separate incident, a hacker recently claimed to have accessed an industrial control system\nresponsible for water supply at another U.S. utility,\u201d the ICS-CERT alert continued. \u201cThe hacker\nposted a series of images allegedly obtained from the system. ICS-CERT is assisting the FBI to\ngather more information about this incident. ICS-CERT has not received any additional reports of\nimpacted manufacturers of ICS or other ICS related stakeholders related to these events. If DHS ICS-\nCERT identifies any information about possible impacts to additional entities, it will disseminate\ntimely mitigation information as it becomes available. ICS-CERT encourages those in the industrial\ncontrol systems community who suspect or detect any malicious activity against/involving control\nsystems to contact ICS-CERT.\u201d\n\nMy story from last week quoted Michael Assante, president and CEO of the National Board of\nInformation Security Examiners and a former chief security officer for the North American Electric\nReliability Corporation (NERC), expressing concern that initial reporting on cyber-related SCADA\nincidents often turns out to be inaccurate.\n\nBut Weiss said the complete reversal makes no sense, and that \u201csomething doesn\u2019t smell right.\u201d By\nway of example, he points to the fact that while media reports on the claimed hack of the Texas\nfacility made today\u2019s DHS Daily Infrastructure Report, the Illinois incident is noticeably absent\nfrom any of the recent editions of that report.\n\n\u201cWhat this is essentially saying is the state intelligence centers shouldn\u2019t put anything out unless\nDHS approves it,\u201d Weiss told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cIt says either Illinois is incompetent or DHS is\ncovering something up.\u201d\n\nState fusion centers, most of which were formed under a joint project between DHS and the Justice\nDepartment between 2003 and 2007, collect data from government and private sector sources. Some of\nthe centers have produced warnings that have been a tad controversial. For example, a report in 2009\nfrom the Virginia Fusion Center warned that certain historically black colleges were potential hubs\nfor terror related activity, and identified hacktivism as a form of terrorism.\n\n", "date": "2011-11-22T00:00:00.000Z", "uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/dhs-blasts-reports-of-illinois-water-station-hack/", "subjectivity": 0.35655677655677653}]
