Like the former, both\ndatabases are said to be in plaintext. The Georgia database was accessed via a network through\nplaintext usernames and passwords while the Central/Midwest U.S. database was retrieved the same\nway, but also by\u00a0exploiting a misconfigured network. \n\nThe hacker apparently decided to sell the information shortly after contacting the companies. When\nasked if they\u2019d pay him to divulge how he was able to secure access to the information, they\nrefused. In response the hacker\u00a0is selling the information for a hefty cost; the databases range in\nprice, from 151 BTC, roughly $100,000, to 607 BTC, roughly $395,000. The information is for sale at\nTheRealDeal, the the same underground marketplace that the hacker \u2018Peace\u2019 sold stolen login\ninformation from social networks VK.com and Myspace.com\u00a0on\u00a0earlier this year. \n\nThe hacker claims to have already sold $100,000 worth of records from the Georgia database \u2013\ninformation that apparently belonged to a Blue Cross Blue Shield regional office \u2013 according to a\nTripwire blog about the hack. \n\nDetails around the specific RDP vulnerability the hacker used are unfortunately few and far between.\nThe protocol\u00a0allows remote display and input capabilities and is usually used\u00a0so tech support can\naccess computers. In May\u00a0attackers targeted corporate networks running Internet-available RDP\nservers. After locating them, they brute forced the servers\u00a0with weak passwords to spread the Bucbi\nransomware.\u00a0A few years ago a botnet made the rounds that also specialized in brute-forcing. It\ntargeted poorly implemented RDP setups that stored payment card information. \n\nAccording to experts the hacker\u2019s actions could serve as a blueprint for the future of ransomware. \n\n\u201cThis is the next stage of ransomware, in which the attacker is mitigating the risk of the victim\nrestoring from backup by keeping a copy of the private data,\u201d including Travis Smith, a senior\nsecurity research engineer with Tripwire said Monday. \n\n\u201cNow the victim may have to make decisions on paying not only to recover their data, but to prevent\nit from being leaked externally. For businesses, this could mean fines and diminished reputation\nfrom the breach. For consumers, this could be private or damaging information,\u201d Smith said. \n\nSmith points out that while a lot of the buzz around ransomware is based around recovering data,\nmore incidents like this could shift the paradigm and force companies to focus more on prevention. \n\n \n\n", "polarity": -0.002264492753623185, "subjectivity": 0.28704710144927537, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/yahoo-investigates-200-million-alleged-accounts-for-sale-on-dark-web/119624/", "date": "2016-08-02T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Yahoo Investigates 200 Million Alleged Accounts For Sale On Dark Web", "body": "Yahoo says it is investigating reports of 200 million user credentials advertised for sale on the\nDark Web by a hacker that goes by the handle \u201cpeace_of_mind\u201d. \n\nThe Yahoo credentials, according to the site listing the database for sale, includes usernames,\npasswords (hashed using the MD5 algorithm), birthdates and backup emails for some accounts.

CryptoLocker is a sophisticated Trojan that uses advanced\ntechniques such as File System Tunneling to avoid detection. \n\nComputers infected by the Stampado are given 96 hours to pay 1 bitcoin ($660) to decrypt files,\naccording to Heimdal Security. Post-infection, attackers threaten to delete just one encrypted file\nfrom infected systems every six hours until the ransomware is paid. \n\nThe sales pitch for the ransomware on dark web is straightforward. This ransomware is priced at $39\nand comes with a lifetime license. Comparable ransomware sold on the dark web can range in price\nfrom a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. CrytpoLocker sold for $3,000 in 2015,\naccording to Heimdal Security. Ransomware-as-a-service, where buyers rent but do not own the\nransomware code, can cost as little as $50 for a set period time of use. \n\n\u201cGiven the price and how it mimics other ransomware such as Jigsaw and CryptoLocker, I suspect the\npeople behind this ransomware are technically unsophisticated script kiddies,\u201d said computer\nforensics expert Lawrence Abrams who maintains the BleepingComputer website. \n\nResearchers say they have not spotted Stampado in live campaigns yet. \n\nThe authors behind the dark web sale of Stampado, it appears, have stolen from the marketing\nplaybook of late night infomercials. The pitch reads: \n\n\u201cYou always wanted a Ransomware but never wanted two pay Hundreds of dollars for it? This list is\nfor you! ?? Stampado is a cheap and easy-to-manage ransomware, developed by me and my team. It\u2019s\nmeant two be really easy-to-use. You\u2019ll not need a host. All you will need is an email account.\u201d \n\n \n\nHeimdal Security told Threatpost that the technical analysis of Stampado is forthcoming, so many\nquestion marks still remain as to its\u00a0capabilities. \n\n\u201cThe differences between Stampado and other ransomware currently being spread reside more in the\nsocial engineering techniques used and in the pricing,\u201d Heimdal Security said. \n\nThe company reports the Stampado ransomware typically uses extensions EXE, BAT, DLL, SCR, and CMD to\ndeliver the ransomware payload. The ransomware encrypts\u00a0files and changes the file extension\nto\u00a0.locked. \n\n\u201cVictims will receive instructions on how to get their data back if they email the attackers at\n\u2018teste [at] email [dot] com\u2019. To show that they will retrieve their data, Stampado makers promise to\ndecrypt one file as a guarantee and then provide payment instructions for the decryption key,\u201d\nHeimdal Security told Threatpost. \n\nStampado joins a recent wave of simple, if not hastily constructed, ransomware. For months, the\nmakers of Jigsaw ransomware have continued their assault against victims despite the fact its\nencryption scheme has been defeated by security researchers. Another ransomware Ranscam, recently\ndiscovered by Cisco\u2019s Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group, just deletes files instead of\nencrypting them. \n\n", "polarity": 0.018795093795093795, "subjectivity": 0.44055607091321375, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/millions-of-stolen-us-university-email-credentials-for-sale-on-the-dark-web--/d/d-id/1328511", "date": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Kelly Jackson Higgins", "title": "Millions of Stolen US University Email Credentials for Sale on the Dark Web  ", "body": "Stolen email addresses and passwords from the largest US universities are offered for sale on the\nDark Web at anywhere from $3.50 to $10 apiece.\n\nBut that's only a snapshot of a lucrative underground market for pilfered \u2013 and even spoofed and\nphony - student, faculty, staff, and alumni email credentials, according to new research published\ntoday by the nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance (DCA) that searched the Dark Web for credentials\nfrom the top 300 US universities.\n\nWith the help of research firm ID Agent, they found 13,930,176 credentials from those big schools,\nwith the University of Michigan (122,556), Penn State (119,350), University of Minnesota (117,604),\nMichigan State (115,973), and Ohio State (114,032), with the most credentials for sale, and MIT with\nthe biggest ratio of stolen and spoofed email addresses to number of enrolled and staff, 2.81:1,\nfollowed by Carnegie Mellon University, 2.4:1, Cornell University, 2.39:1, and others.\n\n\"I've been scraping the Dark Web since 2009. There were 2.2 million .edu [emails] there back in\n2015, 2.8 million in 2016, and now almost 14 million a year later. That's a significant spike,\" says\nBrian Dunn, managing partner\u00a0at ID Agent.\n\nDunn says the massive increase likely has to do with third-party website breaches, where university\nusers register with their .edu email addresses with social media, e-commerce, and other websites\nthat suffered breaches, either reported or unreported. \"There have been significant third-party\nbreaches in 2016,\" he notes. ID Agent has seen a 547% increase in all types of credentials\n(including universities') for sale in the Dark Web over the past three years. Think big breaches at\nYahoo, DropBox, LinkedIn, and others.\n\nThe caveat, however, is that the researchers don't know how many of the stolen passwords are valid\n(they can't legally confirm that). Also, some of the emails are spoofed or phony, but DCA notes that\ndoesn't mean they aren't a danger to a university: spoofed emails are often used in phishing\nattacks. Also, the report only looked at the largest US universities, so other high-profile but\nsmaller-enrollment universities weren't included.\n\nPurveyors of the .edu credentials in the Dark Web are typically cybercriminals, hacktivists, and\nscammers, the researchers say.\n\n\"[The] .edu [domain] is a generally valuable email domain just like .gov and .mil,\" Dunn says.\n\nBuyers can use those stolen credentials to cash in on university discounts, such as software and\nAmazon Prime memberships, for example. They also can use them for phishing or gaining further access\nto university financial, research, and other potentially lucrative information.\n\nMany breaches of all types begin with stolen user credentials. Dunn says one of his firm's clients\nestimates that 94% of network login attempts are executive via automated scripts of reused\ncredentials. \"When you [an attacker] can automate that with a script, you can have tremendous amount\nof success.\"\n\nA University of Michigan spokesperson said the majority of the U-M credentials found in the study\nlikely were the source of students, staff, and alumni, using their school email address when\nregistering for third-party websites, and they don't indicate any new threats to the university.\nEven so, \"we explicitly discourage\" using UMICH passwords for other online accounts.\n\n\"Our Information Assurance group, and other Big 10 IT security organizations, have\u00a0analyzed the\nreport and have determined that there is no new risk or significant threat\u00a0to the university's\nsystems or data,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the university has tools and processes that\n\"help limit any exposure\" when user accounts are compromised.\n\nBut the spokesman pointed out that \"there is no evidence that the accounts and credentials were\nvalid - at U-M or\u00a0elsewhere.\"\n\nOhio State University said DCA's report doesn't indicate any new threats to OSU. \"Together with our\npeer institutions, the university has reviewed the report and determined that there is no new risk\nor significant threat to the university's systems or data. Ohio State has a robust security\nframework which complies with industry standards and includes a number of technology tools and\nprocesses to limit exposure for potentially compromised accounts,\" an OSU spokesperson said in a\nstatement.\n\nHacked university emails and credentials have been in the spotlight plenty of times before. The\nResearch and Education Networking ISAC (REN-ISAC) last year notified universities about the\ncompromise of some 2.2 million user credentials. And back in 2012, the hacktivist group Team\nGhostShell dumped on Pastebin some 36,000 names, email usernames and passwords, phone numbers, and\nother personal online\u00a0information of students, faculty, and staff from 53 of the largest\nuniversities in the world, including Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, and\nCarnegie Mellon.\n\nDCA, while working on its project, reached out to Team GhostShell via Twitter and ended up\ncommunicating via email for several months with a member of GhostShell who claimed to be the the\nleader of hacktivist group Team GhostShell, \"DeadMellox,\" who last year came out of the shadows and\ngave his name as Razvan Eugen Gheorghe, 25, based in Bucharest, Romania. Razvan told the DCA that\nthe data he leaked was only the tip of the iceberg and higher-ed personal information is constantly\nbeing abused.\n\nIn an email exchange with Dark Reading arranged via DCA, Razvan pointed out that the higher-ed\ncredentials for sale in the Dark Web represent a small portion of the overall problem. \u00a0\"The\nfindings themselves of those so called millions of stolen credentials represent a spec of private\ninformation compared to the overall hacking that's being done on a daily basis all around the net,\"\nhe wrote.\n\nRazvan, whose identity as DeadMellox could not be confirmed by Dark Reading, said it's up to the\nhigher-ed institutions to school their users on security threats. \"It's better to have young\nstudents and people in general learn about cybersecurity from their schools, rather than some shady\nhacker marketplace online,\" he said in the email.\n\nThe basic goal of the DCA report was to shed light on the Dark Web's abuse of .edu email accounts\nand credentials. \"We wanted to give their [universities'] IT security teams something they can use\nand talk about with administrators and stakeholders on the scale of the problem \u2026 what kind of\nchallenges they are facing,\" says Adam Benson, deputy executive director of DCA.\n\nUniversity email accounts are juicy targets for opportunistic cybercriminals: \"Some of these schools\nhave thousands of people coming in every year with different levels of sophistication, and education\nabout financial and medical records [for instance]\" and may be using a credit card for the first\ntime, he says.\n\n", "polarity": 0.04075284090909091, "subjectivity": 0.4306486742424241, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/dark-webs-evolution-market-vanishes/", "date": "2015-03-18T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Dark Web\u2019s \u2018Evolution Market\u2019 Vanishes", "body": "The Evolution Market, an online black market that sells everything contraband \u2014 from marijuana,\nheroin and ecstasy to stolen identities and malicious\u00a0hacking services \u2014 appears to have vanished in\nthe last 24 hours with little warning.
