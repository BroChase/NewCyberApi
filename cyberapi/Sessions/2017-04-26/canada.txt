The site\ncame under attack from hackers but was immediately shut down before any damage could be done.\n\nThe security bug in Apache Struts 2 software, used mostly in websites of government, banks, and\nretailers, was reported last week after the Apache Software Foundation came out with an update to\nfix the vulnerability. Users of this software around the world spent the weekend patching up this\nbug which reportedly was being exploited in the wild.\n\nCanadian government official John Glowacki said that other countries \"are actually having greater\nproblems with this specific vulnerability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability is super easy to exploit,\" says Chris Wysopal of security software firm\nVeracode. \"You just point it to the web server and put in the command that you want to run.\"\n\nRead full story here.\n\n", "polarity": 0.0823074494949495, "subjectivity": 0.3655618686868687, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/us-canada-issue-ransomware-advisory/117157/", "date": "2016-04-04T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "US, Canada Issue Ransomware Advisory", "body": "Ransomware clearly has people on many fronts worried, so much so that the United States and Canada\ntook an unprecedented step last week to issue a joint advisory on the threat posed by crypto-\nransomware. \n\nThe U.S. Cyber Emergency Response Team together with the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre\npenned a comprehensive warning on the heels of high-profile infections at hospitals nationwide that\nhave made headlines the past few weeks. \n\nThe advisory describes the threat, potential impact and offers solutions which companies and\nconsumers can take advantage of. \n\n\u201cThe authors of ransomware instill fear and panic into their victims, causing them to click on a\nlink or pay a ransom, and users systems can become infected with additional malware,\u201d the advisory\nreads. \n\nContrary to advice given by the FBI last fall, the respective CERTS say that paying the ransom may\nnot be the best solution. \n\n\u201cPaying the ransom does not guarantee the encrypted files will be released; it only guarantees that\nthe malicious actors receive the victim\u2019s money, and in some cases, their banking information,\u201d the\nadvisory says. \u201cIn addition, decrypting files does not mean the malware infection itself has been\nremoved.\u201d \n\nRansomware has shut down major health care providers, including MedStar Health in the D.C. area, and\nLos Angeles-based Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, affecting not only access to data stored on\ncomputers network-wide, but also patient care as in the case of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical\nCenter, sick and injured has to be shuttled to other facilities in the area. \n\nThe respective CERTS warn against financial loss and reputational harm, in addition to possibly\npermanently corrupted files. The advisory urges organizations to employ common sense computer\nhygiene, starting with regular, available, secure backups of critical information. Application\nwhitelisting and vigilant patching are also recommended; the CERTS also caution that organizations\nshould educate users to avoid enabling macros. Many ransomware strains, including Locky, arrive in\nspam and phishing emails with Word documents posing as a business invoice. The victim is directed to\nenable macros in order to properly view the document, but instead the macro is downloading the\nransomware in the background. \n\nThe speed by which ransomware is evolving is striking, perhaps more so than any other type of\nmalware or exploit. \n\nIn the past two weeks, we\u2019ve seen PowerWare co-opt Windows PowerShell via a malicious macro to pull\ndown the ransomware and avoid writing files to the disk. \n\nMore recently, Petya ransomware was exposed in attacks targeting HR operations at German companies.\nThe twist with Petya is that it spreads via a Dropbox link\u2014which has since been disabled\u2014spammed out\nto organizations. The malware replaces the boot drive\u2019s Master Boot Record with a malicious loader.\nThe malware forces Windows to reboot and displays a phony check disk (CHKDSK) operation to the\nvictim while the malware executes in the background and encrypts the master file table. \n\nResearcher Hasherezade said in a detailed analysis posted to the Malwarebytes blog that despite\nclaims in the ransom note, Petya does not encrypt the full disk; by encrypting the master file\ntable, it makes it so that the file system is not readable. The ransomware executes in stages and\nHasherezade said that if detection happens in the first stage, data can be recovered. \n\n", "polarity": 0.07954902447089944, "subjectivity": 0.37290299399674404, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/new-magikpos-malware-targets-point-of-sale-systems-in-us-and-canada-/d/d-id/1328434", "date": "2017-03-17T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Jai Vijayan", "title": "New MagikPOS Malware Targets Point-of-Sale Systems In US & Canada ", "body": "Security vendor Trend Micro Friday has warned of a new type of point-of-sale (PoS) malware that is\nbeing used to attack PoS systems belonging to businesses in the US and Canada.\n\nThe malware, which Trend Micro has dubbed MajikPOS, was first spotted infecting PoS systems the last\nweek of January and has been used to steal data on at least 23,400 credit cards, Trend Micro said in\nan alert.\n\nTrend Micro researchers describe\u00a0MajikPOS as malware that is similar in purpose to other recent POS\ndata stealing tools, such as FastPOS and ModPOS, but different from them in the manner in which it\ndeploys.\n\n\"The attackers are mapping out victims with relatively generic tools ahead of time,\" says Jon Clay,\nTrend Micro's global threat communications manager.\n\nMany MajikPOS infections have involved the use of a remote access Trojan (RAT) that appears to have\nbeen installed on the systems sometime between August and November last year. The RATs are designed\nto determine if the systems on which they been installed are worthy of further exploitation.\n\nIf the endpoint appears promising, the operators of MajikPOS then use a combination of methods\nincluding VNC, Remote Desktop Connection, and command-line FTP to install the PoS malware. The goal\nis to find systems that are vulnerable without compromising the main weapon in their arsenal, Clay\nsays.\n\nOnce potential victims are identified, the attackers use a pair of executables to\u00a0run the attack \u2014\nan implant and a scraper for getting the card numbers. The approach ensures that if the initial\nstage of an attack fails, the core malware itself is not compromised, Clay says.\n\nThe method of attack indicates that the operators of MajikPOS have taken active precautions to\nmitigate the possibility of their malware being screened for and detected. This suggests that the\noperators of MajikPOS are also the authors the malware, Clay says.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of MajikPOS is that it is coded in .NET, which is a somewhat rare choice\nof a programming framework for malware authors.\n\nOnce installed on a system, MajikPOS inventories it thoroughly for payment card numbers, including\nlooking for them in memory, and then exfiltrates the data to its command-and-control server.\n\nTrend Micro's examination of one of the dumps showed it to contain over 23,000 stolen debit and\ncredit card track data. Prices for individual cards ranged from $9 to $39 depending on card type.\nBulk pricing ranged from $250 for a set of 10 cards to $700 for 100. Cards in the dump included\nthose issued by American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Diners Club.\n\nMeanwhile, in separate but related news, security blog KrebsOnSecurity\u00a0disclosed\u00a0what appears to be\na significant breach of PoS data at Select Restaurants, a company that owns several well-known,\nhigh-end restaurants around the country.\n\nThe breach, according to Krebs, is apparently tied to a previously disclosed intrusion at 24-7\nHospitality Technology, a PoS company that provides credit and debit card processing services to\nthousands of restaurants and eateries around the country. The malware used in the breach though\nappears to be different from the one that Trend Micro warned about.\n\n", "polarity": 0.02606951871657754, "subjectivity": 0.39032976827094473, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/hackers-attack-canada-army-site-redirect-visitors-to-china/d/d-id/1327539", "date": "2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Dark Reading Staff", "title": "Hackers Attack Canada Army Site, Redirect Visitors To China", "body": "Canada\u2019s Defense Ministry has confirmed that hackers recently attacked its armed forces recruitment\nwebsite and changed configurations redirecting visitors to the Chinese government\u2019s official page\ninstead, says a Reuters report.

All of those sources\nsaid they\u2019d identified a pattern of fraud on customer cards that had just one thing in common: They\nwere all recently used at some of Eddie Bauer\u2019s 350+ locations in the U.S. The sources said the\nfraud appeared to stretch back to at least January 2016.\n\nA spokesperson for Eddie Bauer\u00a0at the time\u00a0said the company was grateful for the outreach but that\nit hadn\u2019t heard any fraud complaints from banks or from the credit card associations.\n\nEarlier today, however, an outside public relations firm\u00a0circled back on behalf of\u00a0Eddie Bauer. That\nperson\u00a0told me Eddie Bauer\u00a0\u2014 working with the FBI and an outside computer forensics firm \u2014 had\ndetected and removed card-stealing malware\u00a0from cash registers at all of its locations in the United\nStates and Canada.\n\nThe retailer\u00a0says it believes the malware was capable of capturing credit and debit card numbers\nfrom customer transactions made at all 350 Eddie Bauer stores in the United States and Canada\nbetween January 2, 2016 to July 17, 2016. The company emphasized that this breach did not impact\npurchases made at the company\u2019s online store eddiebauer.com.\n\n\u201cWhile not all transactions during this period were affected, out of an abundance of caution, Eddie\nBauer is\u00a0offering identity protection services to all customers who made purchases or returns during\nthis period,\u201d the company said in a press release issued directly after the markets closed in the\nU.S. today.\n\nGiven the volume of point-0f-sale malware attacks on retailers and hospitality firms in recent\nmonths, it would be nice if each one of these breach disclosures didn\u2019t look and sound exactly the\nsame. For example, in addition to offering\u00a0customers the predictable and irrelevant credit\nmonitoring services topped with bland assurances that the \u201csecurity of our customers\u2019 information is\na top priority,\u201d breached entities could offer the cyber defenders of the world just a few details\nabout the attack tools and online staging grounds the intruders used.\n\nThat way, other companies could use the information to find out if they are similarly victimized and\nto stop the bleeding of customer card data as quickly as possible. Eddie Bauer\u2019s spokespeople say\nthe company has no intention of publishing these so-called \u201cindicators of compromise,\u201d but\nemphasized that Eddie Bauer worked closely with the FBI and outside security experts.\n\nFor more on the importance of IOCs in helping to detect and ultimately\u00a0stymie\u00a0cybercrime, check out\nlast Saturday\u2019s story about IOCs released by Visa in connection with the recent intrusion at\nOracle\u2019s MICROS point-of-sale unit.\u00a0And for the record, I have no information connecting this breach\nor any other recent POS malware attack with the breach at Oracle\u2019s MICROS unit.

Please read the update at the end of this post.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nLast week, Microsoft sent the following notice to IT professionals and others who have signed up to\nreceive email notices of security updates:\n\n\u201cAs of July 1, 2014, due to changing governmental policies concerning the issuance of automated\nelectronic messaging, Microsoft is suspending the use of email notifications that announce the\nfollowing:\u201d\n\n* Security bulletin advance notifications  * Security bulletin summaries  * New security advisories\nand bulletins  * Major and minor revisions to security advisories and bulletins\n\n\u201cIn lieu of email notifications, you can subscribe to one or more of the RSS feeds described on the\nSecurity TechCenter website.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more information, or to sign up for an RSS feed, visit the Microsoft Technical Security\nNotifications webpage at http://technet.microsoft.com/security/dd252948.\u201d\n\nAsked about the reason for the change, a Microsoft spokesperson said email communication was\nsuspended to comply with a new Canadian anti-spam law that takes effect on July 1, 2014.\n\nSome anti-spam experts who worked very closely on Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law (CASL) say they are baffled\nby Microsoft\u2019s response to a law which has been almost a decade in the making.\n\nNeil Schwartzman, executive director of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email (CAUCE),\nsaid CASL contains carve-outs for warranty and product safety and security alerts that would more\nthan adequately exempt the Microsoft missives from the regulation.\n\nIndeed, an exception in the law says it does not apply to commercial electronic messages that solely\nprovide\u00a0\u201cwarranty information, product recall information or safety or security information about a\nproduct, goods or a service that the person to whom the message is sent uses, has used or has\npurchased.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am at a complete and total loss to understand how the people in Redmond made such an apparently\npanicked decision,\u201d Schwartzman said,\u201d noting that Microsoft was closely involved in the discussions\nin the Canadian parliament over the bill\u2019s trajectory and content. \u201cThis is the first company I know\nof that\u2019s been that dumb.\u201d\n\nSchwartzman said\u00a0many companies have used CASL as an excuse to freshen up their email lists and to\nre-engage their customers. Some have even gone so far as to enter\u00a0respondents who verify that they\nstill want to receive email communications from a company into drawings for cash prizes and other\ngiveaways.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve seen nothing but a steady stream of reconfirmation mails from\nvarious companies,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m now in the running for several $500 dollar gift certificates\nbecause I confirmed my email. And at the bottom of each of these messages is a note that says\n\u2018please ignore this offer if you\u2019re not Canadian.'\u201d\n\nCAUCE board member Jeff Williams, a former group program manager at Microsoft\u2019s Malware Protection\nCenter, chalked Microsoft\u2019s decision up to a little more than a tough call.\n\n\u201cI can imagine the discussion and wondering among the lawyers and [Microsoft] whether they should\ntry to get hundreds of millions of opt-ins before\u00a0June 30\u00a0or if they should change the way they\nshare info,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but I wouldn\u2019t call it\nan overreaction.\u201d\n\nIn addition to pushing notices about new updates out via\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s RSS feeds, the company also\nappears to be making the security email alerts available to users who have Live, Outlook or Hotmail\naccounts with Microsoft. And of course, readers can continue to rely on KrebsOnSecurity to feature\ninformation on any new security updates available from Microsoft, including each Patch Tuesday\nbundle as well as emergency, \u201cout-of-band\u201d updates released to address zero-day security threats.\n\nUpdate, 5:40 p.m. ET: In an apparent reversal of its decision, Microsoft now says it will be re-\nstarting its security notifications via email early next month. From a Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson: \u201cOn\nJune 27, 2014, Microsoft notified customers that we were suspending Microsoft Security Notifications\ndue to changing governmental policies concerning the issuance of automated electronic messaging. We\nhave reviewed our processes and will resume these security notifications with our monthly Advanced\nNotification Service (ANS) on\u00a0July 3, 2014.\u201d\n\n", "polarity": 0.10522956841138663, "subjectivity": 0.3879734407007134, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}]
