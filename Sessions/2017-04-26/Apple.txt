The vulnerability stems from a flaw in SSLv2 that relates\nto export-grade cryptography and could have let an attacker leak user information. Apple claims it\nfixed the issue by disabling SSLv2 in Tcl, an embeddable dynamic language interpreter. \n\nRoughly 25 of the 67 OS X patches address vulnerabilities that could ultimately lead to code\nexecution, including 19 issues that could trigger an application to execute code with kernel\nprivileges.\u00a0Six more could result in either application termination or arbitrary code\nexecution\u00a0and\u00a0primarily stem from flaws in graphics standards and frameworks like SceneKit,\nQuicktime, and OpenGL, and libraries like libxml2 and libxslt. \n\nWhile most of the issues exist in Apple\u2019s most recent operating system, El Capitan, 12 bugs were\nfixed in Mavericks 10.9.5 and 14 in Yosemite 10.10.5. \n\nThe libxslt issue in particular, dug up by Sebastian Apelt, a researcher at the German pentesting\nfirm Siberas, exists in all three operating systems. The vulnerability also affects iOS, tvOS, and\nwatchOS by extension, since the XSLT C library exists in each operating system. If an attacker\ntricked a user into visiting a malicious site, the vulnerability could lead to code execution. \n\nThe same 19 issues that could let an application execute code with kernel privileges in OS X also\naffect iOS but were fixed\u00a0Monday. \n\nIn addition, two issues in Messages \u2013 also present in OS X \u2013 were fixed, including one that could\nhave let an attacker modify a users\u2019 contact list, and another that could have let attackers leak\nsensitive user information. \n\nThe iOS update also remedies a lockscreen bypass vulnerability that could have allowed access to\ncontacts and photos. Spanish iPhone researcher, Jose Rodriguez a.k.a videodebarraquito, has dug up a\nhandful of lockscreen bypass bugs in the past and is credited by Apple for finding this particular\nvulnerability. \n\nApple also took the opportunity on Monday to patch a handful of issues in platforms like watchOS and\ntvOS, many of the same bugs it patched in iOS and OS X.

An exploit would\ninclude a crafted IOConnectCallMethod request to the driver that would trigger the vulnerability.\nCisco Talos said in its report that the vulnerable code lies in the driver\u2019s\nIOGen575Shared::new_texture function. \n\nThis type of exploit gives an attacker a way onto an OS X machine with elevated privileges since the\ndriver interacts with the kernel. \n\n\u201cThis driver runs as root,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo if you can take it over, you have root on the box.\u201d \n\nWilliams said that exploit could be sent via email as an attachment or in a link to a website\nhosting the malicious code. Cisco said it has not seen any public attacks exploiting this\nvulnerability, but Williams cautioned that malicious attachments sent over encrypted connections\ncould elude analysts. \n\nOnce the attacker has root access, there are no limits to the payloads the attacker could inject\nnext or uses for the elevated privileges they could gain. \n\n\u201cYou can use this flaw to break out of the root directory as a root user and do what you want; the\nsky is the limit,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThese are the types of vulnerabilities attackers chain together\nwith two or three others to create some very serious exploits.\u201d \n\nApple said in its advisory that it improved memory handling to address this vulnerability; Piotr\nBania of Cisco and Ian Beer of Google Project Zero were credited with finding and disclosing the\nbugs. \n\nOn Monday, Apple patched nearly its entire product line with fixes for vulnerabilities OS X Server,\nOS X, Safari, Xcode, tvOS, watchOS and iOS. \n\nThe iOS 9.3 update was the most high-profile bug addressed in a while by Apple. Graduate student\nresearchers at Johns Hopkins University led by professor Matthew Green examined the security of\niMessage and found a handful of serious vulnerabilities that could be abused and allow an attacker\nto intercept and read attachments sent via iMessage. \n\nThe bugs were a demonstration not only of an exploitable weakness in Apple iOS encryption, but in\ncontext, show that the FBI and government officials could find ways to break into terrorist Syed\nFarook\u2019s iPhone without having to compel Apple into helping by building new firmware that\nintentionally weakens security on the device. \n\n", "polarity": -0.04847943722943721, "subjectivity": 0.517012987012987, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/deluge-of-apple-patches-fix-imessage-crypto-bug-much-more/116926/", "date": "2016-03-22T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Deluge of Apple Patches Fix iMessage Crypto Bug, Much More", "body": "In addition to fixing the serious crypto vulnerabilities in iMessage that surfaced\u00a0yesterday, Apple\nalso deployed patches for nearly all of its products, including Safari, OS X, iOS, Apple TV\u2019s tvOS,\nand watchOS. \n\nThe iOS update, 9.3, is arguably the most pressing given the cryptographic issue dug up by\nresearchers at Johns Hopkins University, but it also fixes a slew of other bugs. \n\nNine memory corruption issues that exist\u00a0in many of the operating system\u2019s kernels and parsers were\naddressed, while a handful of other issues, such as\u00a0use-after-free, denial of service, and out of\nbounds bugs were also fixed.

Shahandashti, and Feng Hao from the university\u2019s School of\nComputing Science discovered that a hidden web page could track user information and \u201cdevice-motion\ndata.\u201d Apple fixed the issue by suspending the availability of that data. \n\nYesterday also brought\u00a0fixes for a dozen issues in Safari, seven involving\u00a0WebKit.

Rogers also explained key objectives he had for both the NSA and\nCyber Command in terms of staffing, training and strategy. \n\n\u201cWe want to harness the private sector through partnerships and integration,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cOne\nreason we are here is all of you. We believe in what you bring to this fight. We believe in the\nknowledge and innovation you help power. The power of partnerships generate the best outcomes for\nthe department, the nation and all of you.\u201d \n\nRogers explained initiatives under way to establish the NSA and Cyber Command with a presence in\nSilicon Valley and partnerships with Stanford University and Cal-Berkeley. \n\n\u201cWe need to spend more time developing the workforce of the future, make it agile and respond to the\nworld as it changes,\u201d he said. We have got to step back and take knowledge from our offensive and\ndefensive pieces and use them to both to generate better outcomes for both of our mission sets. It\nisn\u2019t one or the other. We\u2019re not all about foreign intelligence, or generating insights about\nthreats, but also about harnessing knowledge to improve our defensive capabilities as a nation.\u201d \n\nWhile Rogers was a bit tone deaf expecting tacit cooperation between the security industry and an\nagency exposed by the Snowden documents to conduct dragnet collections of Americans\u2019 data as well as\nsubverting crypto standards and tools putting security and privacy at risk. \n\nThe Apple-FBI debate, meanwhile, puts more of an emphasis on the government\u2019s thirst for data and\nsimultaneously trying to balance privacy and civil liberties. Rogers, however, didn\u2019t mention Apple,\nthe FBI, Going Dark or much about the past two-and-a-half years. \n\n\u201cNo solution is without risk; I acknowledge that,\u201d Roger said. \u201cBut we want to minimize the risk to\nan acceptable level and be honest upfront about the risk. I implore that all of us be part of a\nconstructive dialogue. It\u2019s time to stop talking past each other and figure out how to work together\nto meet imperatives. It\u2019s not one or the other.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.11800000000000001, "subjectivity": 0.3696666666666667, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-launches-bug-bounty-with-maximum-200000-reward/119683/", "date": "2016-08-04T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple Launches Bug Bounty with Maximum $200,000 Reward", "body": "LAS VEGAS\u2014Apple closed out Black Hat today with a long-awaited announcement that next month it will\nlaunch a bug bounty. \n\nThe Apple Security Bounty will be an invitation-only program, open to two dozen researchers at the\noutset, said Ivan Krstic, head of security engineering and architecture. The maximum payout is\n$200,000 and five classes of bugs in iOS and iCloud are in scope. \n\nKrstic made it clear that the bounty isn\u2019t rigidly closed and that researchers submitting\nvulnerability reports in any of the five eligible classes could also be considered for invitation. \n\nKrstic made the announcement to a loud ovation close to the end of his 50-minute speaking slot,\nduring which he also made time for 10 minutes of Q&A. The majority of his talk was spent taking a\ndeep technical dive into iOS 10 security features, including the new hardened WebKit JIT mapping\nfeature that makes it much tougher for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in the\niOS Safari JIT. \n\nBut the star attraction the bounty announcement. Apple said the maximum reward will be $200,000 for\nvulnerabilities and proof-of-concept code in secure boot firmware components. It will also pay\n$100,000 for the extraction of confidential material protected by its Secure Enclave Processor,\n$50,000 for code execution flaws with kernel privileges or unauthorized access to iCloud account\ndata on Apple servers, and $25,000 access from a sandboxed process to user data outside that\nsandbox. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had great help from researchers like you in improving iOS security all along. As the\nmechanisms we build get stronger, the feedback I\u2019ve gotten from my team is that it\u2019s getting\nincreasingly difficult to find those vulnerabilities,\u201d Krstic said. \u201cThe Apple bounty program will\nreward researchers who share critical vulnerabilities with Apple and we will make it a top priority\nto resolve those and provide public recognition.\u201d \n\nApple is not expected to reveal the two-dozen researchers it has invited to the program. \n\n\u201cThe difficulty in finding most of the critical vulnerabilities is going up and up as we invest in\nnew security technology and mechanisms,\u201d Krstic said. \u201cThe difficulty is such that we want to reward\npeople for their time and creativity they put in to finding bugs in these categories.\u201d \n\nRich Mogull, analyst and CEO at consultancy Securosis said that Apple is deliberate in everything it\ndoes. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Apple way,\u201d Mogull wrote in an analysis published shortly after the announcement. \u201cFocus\non\u00a0quality, not\u00a0quantity.

ZDI paid out nearly $2 million in rewards in 2016, the group\nreported this week.\n\nAs for the bigger software vulnerability picture, Adobe products accounted for 149 of advisories, or\n22% of the ZDI total, same as in 2015. Adobe Reader, Acrobat, and Flash were the main culprits, and\nZDI expects the trend to continue as more browsers block Flash by default. In addition, Adobe\ndoesn't operate its own bounty program for bugs and vulnerabilities, unlike Microsoft and Apple. And\nAdobe is already off to an auspicious start in 2017; ZDI communications manager Dustin Childs tells\nDark Reading his organization just notified the vendor of eight new vulnerabilities.\n\nMicrosoft fell to number three on ZDI's 2016 list and it had a lower percentage of published ZDI\nadvisories - 11% - down from the previous year's 17%. But those numbers don't tell the whole story,\nsince Microsoft itself published more security bulletins in 2016 than ever before. Microsoft's\nbiggest problem was the continued targeting of browsers; while its Edge browser was supposed to be\nmuch more secure than Internet Explorer, almost two-thirds (64%) of Microsoft-related ZDI advisories\nwere related to browsers.\n\nAdvisories for Apple products made a significant jump in 2016. There were 61 ZDI advisories posted\nfor the vendor's products in 2016, or 9% of the total, more than what it posted in 2014 and 2015 \u2013\n4% both years. The jump isn't completely surprising to Childs, who notes Apple's more pervasive\npresence with desktop computing, not to mention its smartphone dominance. The installed base of OSX\nand iOS combined is larger than Windows, Childs adds, and predicts more Apple vulnerabilities in\n2017 through ZDI and Apple's own bug bounty program.\n\nTrend Micro, which owns ZDI, also predicts the percentage of Microsoft advisories will continue to\ndrop in 2017 while Apple's increase.\n\nIndustrial computing vendor Advantech made its debut on the ZDI list at number two with 112\nadvisories published \u2013 17% of the published advisories. \"This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean this vendor\nhas a wide surface attack area,\" Childs writes in a ZDI blog post. \"All of these cases came in\nthrough the same anonymous researcher, meaning the researcher found a specific type of bug prevalent\nin their systems,\" Childs says, adding that the same researcher reported no bugs from any other\nvendor in 2016.\n\nWhile Advantech's issues were a surprise, Childs says he also expected to see more enterprise\nsoftware cropping up on the 2016 list from vendors like HP, Dell, or Oracle. \"There's a bunch of\nenterprise software that hasn't been closely looked at, so there's a lot of bugs for researchers to\nfind,\" he says. And though browsers have become well-trod territory, this business middleware market\nis mostly untouched.\n\nNonetheless, infosec professionals and executives should be careful with lists like these, since\nlooking at the numbers without much context doesn\u2019t make for better security decisions in the\nfuture, warns Jeremiah Grossman, a security researcher and chief of security strategy at\nSentinelOne.\n\n\"These figures see significant and subjective variation in what\u2019s included, how things are counted,\nand more, which can largely throw off the numbers from one year to the next,\" he tells Dark Reading\nin an email. \"And of course cybercriminals really don\u2019t care how many reported vulns a particular\nproduct has, mostly because they only need one (or maybe a small handful) that\u2019s wired into their\nexploitation tools for easy deployment.\"\n\nChilds counters that it's important to understand how ZDI's list get compiled. \"It's important to\nsee how the list is created - these are the bugs coming through our program,\" he says. \"They may not\nbe representative of all the research going on\u2026 we don't do anything with mobile yet, for example.\nBut if you look back at the last couple years, you can definitely see some trends,\" like Adobe's\nrecurring presence.\n\n", "polarity": 0.16762656325156328, "subjectivity": 0.5040473184223182, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/google-adwords-malvertising-campaign-targets-apple-macs-/d/d-id/1327357", "date": "2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Sara Peters", "title": "Google Adwords Malvertising Campaign Targets Apple Macs ", "body": "Apple Mac owners using the Google search engine may have been infected via malicious ads at the tip-\ntop of their search results last week after attackers launched a malvertising campaign against\nGoogle Adwords.

The campaign found last year used\n\"youtube.\" This one used the words \"google chrome.\"\n\nTang did the search, saw the ad for Chrome, and clicked on it - which he confesses was \"mindless,\"\nbut he \"had no indication there was something strange.\"\n\nThe ad itself showed a display URL of www.google.com/chrome.\u00a0The URL displayed in the lower right-\nhand corner when scrolling over the link showed the same \"legitimate-looking display URL.\"\n\nYet, as Tang describes in a blog today: \"clicking on the ad takes a user to\nwww(dot)entrack(dot)space and then redirects the user to googlechromelive(dot)com \u2013 a page offering\na free download of Google Chrome.\"\n\nTang spotted this as \"totally not a legitimate page.\" He found a safe place to download Chrome for\nhis girlfriend, then did more digging.\n\n Black Hat Europe 2016 is coming to London's Business Design Centre November 1 through 4.

OSX/InstallCore.\nAs Tang explains on his blog today:\n\n\"...the malicious download link redirects macOS users through ttb(dot)mysofteir(dot)com,\nservextrx(dot)com, and www(dot)bundlesconceptssend(dot)com then ultimately downloads a malicious\nfile named FLVPlayer.dmg.

Clicking on the link takes the user to macpurifier(dot)com\n\u2013 a potentially unwanted program (PUP) claiming to cleanup OS X computers.\"\n\nTang describes the attackers as middlemen, installing someone else's malware and paid per install.\nThe fact that the malvertisers have targeted Mac is a sign that attackers have recognized Apple's\nmarket share is growing, Tang notes.\n\nBut it's also possible that the campaign could have been planned for PCs as well. The fact that\nWindows users are redirected to a page that returns an error message could mean \"either there's a\nmisconfiguration or it's not set up yet,\" he says. \"I'd like to think they're equal opportunity\nmalvertisers,\" he added, wryly.\n\nThe campaign might have been stopped from the beginning, however, if there had been a more rigorous\nverification process when creating the ad. If Google AdWords and other ad networks verified that an\nad re-directed to the same URL it displayed, it could prevent malvertising threats like this.\n\nHe acknowledges that there is a massive scalability challenge if ad networks need to do this\nverification with a manual process, but says that he thinks it's \"ridiculous\" that at least the\nprimary domain isn't matched.\n\n\"It blows my mind,\" says Tang, \"that here we are, it's 2016, and we're still allowing this\nmischievous behavior.\"\n\n", "polarity": 0.07835034013605442, "subjectivity": 0.5732482993197279, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/apple-mac-iphone-bugs-that-cia-allegedly-exploited-were-fixed-years-ago/d/d-id/1328484", "date": "2017-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Jai Vijayan", "title": "Apple: Mac, iPhone Bugs That CIA Allegedly Exploited Were Fixed Years Ago", "body": "The Apple desktop and mobile product vulnerabilities that were revealed this week, in a WikiLeaks\ndata dump of documents allegedly describing several secret CIA projects, were all fixed years ago,\nApple said Friday.\n\nThe leaked information on the Apple vulnerabilities is from a larger collection of documents that\nWikiLeaks has dubbed \"Vault 7,\" containing hitherto classified information on the CIA\u2019s malware\ntools and hacking capabilities.\n\nThe documents show that the CIA\u2019s Embedded Development Branch developed multiple techniques for\nbreaking into Apple phones and desktops and gaining persistence on them.\n\nOne of the attacks was dubbed \"Sonic Screwdriver\" and was designed to let an attacker execute code\non peripheral devices, like a USB stick, while a Mac laptop or desktop was booting. The method\nallowed an attacker to load attack software from a USB device even if a firmware password was\nenabled to prevent that from happening.\n\nAnother leaked document described an alleged CIA implant called \u201cDarkSeaSkies\" that was capable of\npersisting in the Extensible\u00a0Firmware\u00a0Interface (EFI) of an Apple MacBook Air system.\n\nAlso released this week was a document pertaining to Mac OS X malware developed by the CIA called\nTriton and an EFI-persistent version of the tool dubbed DerStarke. While some of the tools described\nin the dump date back to 2013, there is evidence that the CIA has continued to update and use some\nof the other tools, WikiLeaks claimed in a statement.\n\nIncluded in the release are details of NightSkies 1.2, an implant for the Apple iPhone that was\ninstalled physically on new iPhones. The implant suggests the CIA infected the supply chain of its\ntargets at least since 2008, the site claimed.\n\nIn a statement, Apple said the company\u2019s preliminary assessment of the leaked documents shows that\nthe alleged iPhone vulnerability that NightSkies exploited affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed\nback in 2009 along with the release of the iPhone 3GS. \u201cAdditionally, our preliminary assessment\nshows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013,\u201d the\nstatement said.\n\nAs per its usual practice, WikiLeaks has not revealed how it obtained the Vault 7 documents.

Yet, with less than four weeks to that deadline, a vast majority of the top iOS apps\ninstalled on enterprise devices have not yet implemented the feature.\n\nSecurity vendor Appthority recently reviewed 200 applications commonly found on iOS devices that\nconnect to enterprise data and networks to see how many have enabled ATS and how fully.\n\nAppthority\u2019s review found that just 3% of the top 200 iOS apps used in enterprises have implemented\nATS without any exceptions. Nearly 83% of the apps, or 166 out of 200, have disabled ATS for all\nnetwork connections, while some 55% allowed use of HTTP rather than requiring HTTPS connections. And\nnearly all (97%) of the apps reviewed specified changes or included exceptions that weakened ATS.\n\niOS apps that had not yet implemented 100% HTTPS at the time of Appthority\u2019s review included\nMicrosoft products like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote, messaging apps such as Facebook and\nWhatsapp, social network applications, and utility apps such as flashlight and barcode readers.\n\nATS is a security feature in Apple\u2019s OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 operating systems that essentially\nforces an application to connect to Web services via HTTPS rather than HTTP. It also requires app\ndevelopers to build in support in their apps for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher.\n\nATS is designed to enhance data security and privacy by ensuring that applications use strong\nencryption when communicating with app servers and services.\n\nIt comes enabled by default in iOS 9 and the El Capitan versions of Apple\u2019s mobile and desktop\noperating systems. Application vendors have to explicitly disable the setting or set exceptions to\nit.\n\nFor example, there are many situations where an application might need to interact with a Web\nservice that does not support encryption or has no need for it, says Robbie Forkish, vice president\nof engineering at Appthority.\n\nIn order for the application to be able to continue interacting with the Web service, Apple allows\ndevelopers to request an exception to the ATS requirement in such cases. Similarly, app vendors can\nalso seek to disable the setting when their apps have to handle certain types of media files, he\nsays.\n\nApple has established a process where app developers can request exceptions to the ATS settings and\nit reviews those requests and decides whether to grant them or not.\n\nApple is one among several major technology vendors that have been leading the call for encryption\neverywhere as a security best practice.\n\nApple\u2019s deadline requires all developers with apps in Apple Store to implement ATS or provide\n\"reasonable justification\" for not doing so by the end of the year. The company has said that after\nJanuary 1, app developers will not be able to update their products in Store without switching on\nATS first.\n\nWhat this means is developers will either need to somehow implement ATS in the next three weeks or\nface the prospect of not being able to update their apps until they do so, Forkish says.\n\nUsers themselves will be able to continue using the applications as usual. But anyone expecting a\nhigher degree of security and privacy in the app use as a result of the ATS requirement will likely\nnot have it in such cases.\n\nApple has said it will allow exceptions to ATS if developers have a good reason for it. So\norganizations can expect to see iOS apps with unencrypted data even after the Jan 1 deadline passes,\nForkish says.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n", "polarity": 0.18546626984126988, "subjectivity": 0.4575396825396825, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/apple-mac-os-malware-spiked-in-q4-/d/d-id/1328591", "date": "2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Kelly Sheridan", "title": "Apple Mac OS Malware Spiked in Q4 ", "body": "Mac OS malware increased by 247% in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to a new report by McAfee\nLabs.\n\nThe dramatic increase in Apple Mac OS malware samples went from 50,000 in Q3 2016 to about 320,000\nin Q4.\n\nMcAfee Labs VP Vincent Weafer says the increase can be partially attributed to hackers setting their\nsights beyond Windows targets. More people are using multi-platform environments in their homes and\nbusinesses, he explains, and attackers are taking advantage.\n\n\"The more that happens, the more hackers will ensure their attacks work on various systems,\" he\nsays. \"It's a natural extension of how they look at the market and their victims.\"\n\nCybercriminals are expanding their campaigns onto other platforms, going from Windows to Mac OS,\niOS, and Android. While PCs remain the target of choice for large attack campaigns, the report shows\nthat they are using the same types of attacks on a smaller scale for different platforms.\n\n(Image: McAfee Labs)\n\n\"No platform is immune to attackers,\" Weafer\u00a0\u00a0says. \"Attackers are taking the time to make their\nthreats multi-platform.\"\n\nThe biggest driver behind the 247% growth in Mac OS malware was OSX/Bundlore, Weafer says. Bundlore\nis an installer that combines legitimate apps with offers for third-party apps users may not want.\nThese third-party apps are usually installed by default but may present an \"opt-out\" option\nfollowing installation.\n\nMuch of the Mac OS malware variants follow patterns similar to malware on PCs. Attackers are going\nafter credentials, banking information, and access into organizations. They're using misleading\napplications, remote access programs, info stealers, and ransomware, which saw a large expansion\nonto Mac platforms last year as well, he says.\n\nWeafer notes the dramatic growth is related to the relatively small number of Mac devices. There are\nhundreds of thousands of new instances of Mac OS malware, but there are tens of millions on the PC\nside.\n\n\"In general, you see more spikes when you have lower numbers,\" he notes. The Q4 spike in Mac OS\nmalware peaked at about 320,000, which equates to about 1.3% of the Windows volume.\n\nThe higher numbers from Q4 will likely go down, Weafer continues. This dramatic spike is short-term\nbut malware is increasing overall, year-over-year, with more attacks on Macs, PCs, Android, and iOS.\n\nMalware will continue to increase as the IoT grows and more devices, including cameras and drones,\nenter the mix. \"We're living in a multi-platform, cloud environment and we need to think about the\nsecurity of all these systems,\" he emphasizes.\n\nThe Mac OS malware spike doesn't mean Mac-heavy businesses should be rethinking their strategies,\nWeafer continues. Basic security principles are still key and standard precautions should be in\nplace: implementing security software, paying attention to app updates, knowing where data is\nlocated, and protecting it with strong and unique passwords.\n\nMcAfee's report also includes insight on Mirai, the botnet that exploited poorly secured IoT devices\nin October 2016 to launch the largest-ever DDoS attack. In the six months since then, Mirai has\ninfected about 2.5 million IoT devices, McAfee discovered. About five IP addresses are added to\nMirai botnets every minute.\n\nResearchers also discussed drivers behind the rise in intelligence-sharing.

And so far the feds aren\u2019t saying just\nhow they were able to finally obtain the data, which means there\u2019s a vulnerability Apple now must\nfind and fix on its own if the FBI doesn\u2019t share it with the tech firm.\n\nIt's unclear whether the FBI ultimately will share the flaw or technique with Apple. The FBI is\nunder \u201cno obligation\u201d to do so, says David Raissipour, senior vice president of product and\nengineering at Carbonite.\n\n\u201cWhat they found is what Apple was afraid of, anyway: that there some some vulnerability ... that\ncircumvents its security,\u201d he says. Ideally, the FBI would share its finding with Apple, he says,\nbut the agency likely doesn\u2019t want to give up its edge in cracking the backlog of other locked\niPhone cases.\n\nSince Apple has made it clear it won\u2019t play ball and provide the FBI a backdoor, the FBI had to go\nit alone, and that means the FBI expands its own capabilities for cracking the devices, says David\nMaynor, CTO at Errata Security. \u201cNow the FBI is able to expand its 0day capabilities for good\nreasons.\u201d\n\nSo Apple\u2019s victory of standing tall to the feds\u2019 requests for a backdoor into this specific iPhone\nmay be short-lived. The long-term implications, Maynor says, are that the FBI must \u201choard 0day now\u201d\nto conduct future similar investigations that require getting iPhone data.\n\nMeanwhile, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argues that if the FBI indeed used a previously\nunknown vulnerability to crack the phone, it must disclose that to Apple. \u201cThanks to a lawsuit by\nEFF,\u00a0the government has released its official policy\u00a0for determining when to disclose security\nvulnerabilities, the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP),\u201d EFF staff attorney Andrew Crocker\nwrote in a blog post\u00a0last night. \u201cIf the FBI used a vulnerability to get into the iPhone in the San\nBernardino case, the VEP must apply, meaning that there should be a very strong bias in favor of\ninforming Apple of the vulnerability. That would allow Apple to fix the flaw and protect the\nsecurity of all its users. We look forward to seeing more transparency on this issue as well.\"\n\nApple says the FBI was out of line in its legal proceeding. \u201cThis case should never have been\nbrought,\u201d Apple said in a statement after the FBI\u2019s dismissal of the suit, noting that the FBI\u2019s\ndemands \u201cwould have set a dangerous precedent\u201d of backdoors into devices.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to help law enforcement with their investigations, as we have done all along, and\nwe will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data\nbecome more frequent and more sophisticated,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis case raised issues which\ndeserve a national conversation about our civil liberties, and our collective security and privacy.\nApple remains committed to participating in that discussion.\u201d\n\nJust how much a new hole in the iPhone 5c puts users at risk is unclear. \u201cIdeally, it all comes down\nto risk,\u201d says Chris Pierson, CSO and general counsel at Viewpost. It depends on what weakness was\nfound, how it was exploited, and whether it\u2019s something other attackers could abuse in similarly\nconfigured devices, he says.\n\n\u201cIf it only applies to that specific phone with that specific operating system and only certain\nfactors at play,\u201d then the widespread risk would be low, Pierson says. \u201cWhether the severity or\nlikelihood of it being found by others, and what it means to the broader population\u201d is the\nquestion, he says.\n\nAlso unclear is just who was the \u201cthird party\u201d that assisted the FBI in cracking the phone.\nSpeculation has run from security experts in the private sector to the NSA.\n\nWhat happens now with the FBI-Apple relationship in the aftermath of the case? Viewpost\u2019s Pierson\nsays the best thing that could happen next is for the FBI to extend an \u201colive branch\u201d to Apple and\nthe security industry.\n\nThe FBI should initiate a meeting with security industry experts where the FBI could share details\nof the hack with \u201ccleared members from industry and academia who would be able to provide advice,\nguidance, and feedback, on what the bureau can do differently and what avenues to take in the future\nwhen it happens again,\u201d he says. \u201cThese would be just suggestions, not locking\u201d them into anything,\nhe notes.\n\nFind out more about security threats at Interop 2016, May 2-6, at the Mandalay Bay Convention\nCenter, Las Vegas.

So Apple alone is the only one that can remove those barriers as well especially because of\nthe extremely tight controls it exerts over the platform, the government said in its brief.\n\nContrary to Apple\u2019s highly publicized claims, the government is not seeking any kind of a master key\nfrom Apple for unlocking encryption on all iPhones. Instead, all it wants from Apple, according to\nthe motion, is \u201ca narrow, targeted piece of software capable of running on\u00a0just one iPhone, in the\nsecurity of Apple\u2019s corporate headquarters.\n\n\"Apple\u2019s rhetoric is not only false, but also corrosive of the very institutions that are best able\nto safeguard our liberty and our rights: the\u00a0courts, the Fourth Amendment, longstanding precedent\nand venerable laws, and the democratically elected branches of\u00a0government.\"\n\nThe FBI wants Apple\u2019s help in unlocking an iPhone 5C that was recovered from Syed Farook, one of two\nindividuals killed in a police shootout shortly after they allegedly shot dead 14 people in a terror\nattack in San Bernardino last December.\n\nThe FBI states it believes that the phone contains information that could help in its investigation\nof the massacre. But the agency has been unable to get at the data so far, because it does not have\nthe passcode for unlocking the device.\n\nLike other iPhone 5Cs, the recovered device has a mechanism that can erase all data on it after 10\nfailed passcode attempts. It also has a feature that imposes a lengthening delay between password\nretries after every failed attempt. The FBI wants Apple to write code for overriding these\nmechanisms so it can try and brute-force the password. Apple has refused to comply, even after a\nmagistrate judge ordered the company to do so last month.\n\nApple argued in a motion filed last month that what the government is seeking is no different from\ngiving it a key to unlock all iPhones. The company has claimed that in order to comply with the\ngovernment\u2019s request Apple engineers would need to essentially write a new version of iOS capable of\ncircumventing the existing protections. Anyone with access to the software would be able to break\ninto any iPhone, the company has claimed.\n\nNumerous technology companies, privacy groups and rights advocacy organizations have supported\nApple\u2019s position on the issue. They have said that what Apple is being asked to do is to enable a\nbackdoor in its products that would give government and criminals alike a way into them. They have\nwarned that if Apple were to accede to the government\u2019s demand it would open the floodgates to\nsimilar requests from others.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s brief this week characterized those concerns as self-serving rhetoric by one of the\nworld\u2019s most influential and richest technology companies.\n\nThe All Writs Act upon which the government has based its case is neither as archaic nor underused\nas Apple has suggested, government lawyers wrote in their brief. Though the law was passed in 1789,\nit remains relevant even today and has been used previously to get technology companies to do\nexactly the sort of thing that Apple is being asked to do, they argued.\n\nAs one example, they pointed to a case more than 35 years ago where a technology company was ordered\nto write a program for capturing all incoming calls to a particular phone number. Though the\ncompany, like Apple, had protested the requirement as being burdensome and unreasonable, the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals had upheld the order as being valid under the All Writs Act, the lawyers\nsaid.\n\nThey downplayed Apple\u2019s suggestion that writing the code would be burdensome, pointing to the\ncompany\u2019s over 100,000 employees and \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in revenues. They also\ndismissed the company\u2019s concerns of privacy intrusions and government-ordered backdoors as being\nneedlessly alarming and insisted that what Apple is being asked to do is specific to one phone and\nnothing else.\n\n\u201cThat is\u00a0a diversion.\u00a0Apple\u00a0desperately\u00a0wants\u2014desperately needs\u2014this case not to be about one\nisolated iPhone,\u201d the government said in its brief.\n\nFind out more about security threats and privacy issues\u00a0at Interop 2016, May 2-6, at the Mandalay\nBay Convention Center, Las Vegas.

From tapping copper telephone lines to bypassing the\npasscode on a mobile phone, the next frontier in the privacy/encryption debate will be over apps and\ncloud-based storage. Just as innovation has advanced the nature of how we communicate and\ncollaborate, tech companies outside of telecom and mobile need to start paying attention to these\ndevelopments, specifically with respect to cloud service providers like Amazon.\n\nThe concept of using encryption in a broad federated environment that protects data from the bad\nguys but still provides decryption capabilities for authorized stake holders including government\nparticipants are not new concepts. The financial and payments industries have had to manage these\nprograms for years. Most of those organizations would not characterize the decryption methods\nimplemented as a back door or weakened security as Apple has. The new challenge is how or whether\napplying these methods in new environments and platforms that affect an individual\u2019s or private\norganization\u2019s right to privacy is the best approach. There is a litany of potential unintended\nconsequences. A major one could be a significant government interference on the free market\ncompetitiveness of technology companies.\n\nAs the matters surrounding Apple and Google continue to unfold, new information around law\nenforcement inquiries will come to light. The FBI\u2019s fight against Apple has faded from mainstream\nmedia headlines for now, but ambiguities in the law have yet to be resolved in the United States.\nThat means we can expect to see a greater discussion around amending privacy laws to address the\nhandling of mobile devices and applications. In fact, a draft bill from Senators Dianne Feinstein\nand Richard Burr leaked last week is focused directly at providing the government legal ground to\nrequire device and cloud technology providers to enable government\u2019s access to encrypted data.\n\nGain insight into the latest threats and emerging best practices for managing them.

It wouldn\u2019t be a\nstretch of the imagination to see such measures gain popularity back in the U.S., as lawmakers\nscramble to find a means to a larger policy solution.\n\nThe Board is listening\n\nThis creates a prescient reminder for board members and CISOs alike. A 2015 survey by the New York\nStock Exchange, for example, found that more than 80 percent of public company board members are\ndiscussing cybersecurity at most or all of their respective boardroom meetings.\n\nAnd yet, a wider public discussion of the issues has, largely, been lacking. Perhaps that\u2019s borne\nout of procrastination. But what\u2019s clear is that developing a privacy framework that satisfies as\nmany concerns as possible should be a top-of-list agenda item. For the protection of their business\nmodel, and customers, mobile platform developers and cloud service providers need to be at the table\nduring these discussions to ensure that laws do not provide government agencies too much leeway\nwhile also living up to their civic duty to not undermine public safety.\n\nBecause lawmakers have been slow to adapt to the pace of technology, criminal investigators have\nsought to manipulate centuries-old legal precedents as a means of recovering what they consider\ncritical information in the wake of a terror or criminal attack. Solutions that are secure but which\nalso promote privacy are essential. However, this can only be achieved through a proactive and\ncooperative approach. Can the security industry, working with law enforcement, curtail the next\ngeneration of legal challenges, ensuring that Amazon or Microsoft doesn\u2019t become the next Apple?\nThat\u2019s an open question with the future, much like the potential legal challenges to come, very much\nup in the clouds.\n\n", "polarity": 0.1333930211202938, "subjectivity": 0.41327544929817656, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/apples-workflow-for-enterprise-ios-app-distribution-vulnerable-to-attack/d/d-id/1324937", "date": "2016-03-31T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Jai Vijayan", "title": "Apple\u0092s Workflow For Enterprise iOS App Distribution Vulnerable To Attack", "body": "Security vendor Check Point Software Technologies has sounded the alarm on an apparent weakness in\nApple\u2019s application distribution workflow for enterprises that it says gives attackers an opening to\ninstall malware on iPhones and iPads used by enterprise users.\n\nThe SideStepper flaw affects iOS 9 devices enrolled with an enterprise Mobile Device Management\n(MDM) system and can be exploited to take complete control of vulnerable devices, Check Point\nwarned. Potentially millions of iOS 9 devices enrolled in enterprise MDM systems are vulnerable to\nattack.\n\nIn a white paper, Check Point researchers Avi Bashan and Ohad Bobrov described the flaw as enabling\nadversaries to execute a man-in-the middle (MITM) attack for intercepting communications between a\nmanaged iOS device and the MDM server. Such an attack would allow threat actors to install malware\nof their choice on a vulnerable device and take full control of it without the user\u2019s knowledge.\n\nBut in order to pull it off, an attacker first must compromise the user\u2019s device.\n\nThe SideStepper vulnerability exists in the process that Apple offers to enterprises for installing\ninternally developed iOS applications on iPhones and iPads.\n\nTypically, users who want to download an iOS app can only get it through Apple\u2019s official App Store,\nunless of course they have jailbroken their device. All apps in the App Store go through a thorough\nsecurity review and vetting process and are digitally signed by Apple before they are available for\ndownload. Usually, only Apple-signed applications can run on non-jailbroken iOS devices.\n\nApple offers an Apple Developer Enterprise program for organizations that want to develop and\ninstall their own iOS apps without having to go through the company\u2019s usual vetting process. For\nsuch organizations, Apple offers a signed enterprise certificate that can be used to sign internally\ndeveloped iOS apps so they can be installed on enterprise iPhones and iPads.\n\nSuch enterprise certificates have been frequently abused in the past to distribute malicious and\npirated applications. As Bashan and Bobrov note in the white paper, third-party app stores have in\nthe past registered themselves as legitimate enterprises with Apple in order to obtain signed\nenterprise certificates from the company, which they have then used to distribute third-party apps.\n\nIn 2015, the issue gained considerable attention when the Hacking Team took advantage of an Apple\nenterprise certificate it owned and a previously discovered flaw dubbed Masque Attack to distribute\na malicious app to devices running iOS versions 8.1.3 and earlier.\n\nIn order to address the shortcomings, Apple introduced some tighter security measures for enterprise\napp installation with the release of iOS 9, the two security researchers said. Enterprise users for\ninstance have to go through a \u201cmaze of settings screens\u201d to confirm the app\u2019s developer when they\nwant to install an enterprise iOS app on their devices for the first time, they said.\n\n\u201cApple did leave a loophole, however,\u201d according to Bashan and Bobrov. \u201ciOS natively trusts any app\ninstalled by MDM solutions, which are exclusively used by businesses.\u201d\n\nSo by intercepting communications between a managed iOS device and the MDM server, an attacker could\ninstall malware over-the-air on devices running iOS 9. In order to exploit the SideStepping weakness\nusing an MITM attack, however, an attacker would first need to find a way to compromise a user\nsystem and get it to route traffic to a malicious server. Such a compromise can be accomplished via\na phishing attack, Check Point said.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability is actually in the way Apple implemented this fix for making enterprise apps more\ndifficult to install,\u201d says Avi Rembaum, vice president of security solutions at Check Point. The\nchanges that Apple made in the app distribution workflow with iOS 9 adds several steps intended to\nmake it clear to the user that he or she is doing something that\u2019s not typical behavior for an\naverage user, he says.\n\n\u201c[But], it doesn\u2019t address over-the-air installation of malicious enterprise apps should an attacker\nstage a MITM attack on a device\u2019s communication with an MDM,\" he says.\n\nAttacks of this type theoretically could be exploited on a mass scale, Rembaum says. \u201cBut it\u2019s more\nlikely that it\u2019d be used to target a specific individual, or groups of individuals.\u201d\n\nCheck Point says it informed Apple of the problem in October 2015.\u00a0 \u201cApple responded in November\n2015 that the behavior the research team demonstrated \u2018is expected,'\u201d Check Point said.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n", "polarity": 0.02, "subjectivity": 0.3954999999999999, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/mobile/how-some-apple-android-mobile-tax-apps-put-sensitive-data-at-risk/d/d-id/1325000", "date": "2016-04-06T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Jai Vijayan", "title": "How Some Apple, Android Mobile Tax Apps Put Sensitive Data At Risk", "body": "E-filing tax returns via a smartphone can be convenient and fast, but many of the income tax-filing\napps people use are not so secure.\n\nWith this year\u2019s tax deadline looming, security vendor Appthority decided to do a quick analysis of\nseveral mobile tax applications. In all, the company reviewed 29 Android and Apple iOS tax\napplications for risky behaviors such as collecting and transmitting personally identifiable\ninformation, sharing location data with third parties, and transmitting sensitive tax data without\nencryption.\n\nThe results were a mixed a bag. On the one hand, many of the applications that Appthority reviewed\nhave vulnerabilities that put highly sensitive user data like Social Security Numbers and earnings\ninformation, at risk. But none of them are severe enough to warn users off them altogether.\n\nAccording to Appthority, the goal of the review is to alert mobile users about the potentially risky\nbehavior of tax apps -- some of which have been developed by companies with considerable resources\nand development experience. \u201cWe suspect even more vulnerabilities can be found in lesser known apps\nwhich are not developed with enterprise grade resources,\u201d the company said.\n\nHere are some of the potential risks, organized by severity level, that Appthority identified in the\nmobile tax-filing apps:\n\n1. Low-risk vulnerabilities\n\nA total of eight mobile tax applications exhibit what Appthority describes as low-risk\nvulnerabilities stemming from a failure to adhere to security best practices. The most common among\nthem are so-called full path disclosure flaws that basically enable an attacker to see the entire\npath to the app\u2019s source code.\n\nSuch vulnerabilities allow a way into server-side code from the client, and can give adversaries\ncritical information on how to attack an application. This type of vulnerability can occur when\neither the developer of the app or development kit used to write the app fails to delete its source\ncode, Appthority says.\n\nSuch vulnerabilities do not pose a direct threat to users of these apps, but they can be problematic\nin an enterprise or government context.\n\nApps with this kind of vulnerability include the iOS versions of TurboTax, one of the most popular\ntax-filing apps; Evernote; Expensify; and IRS2Go. With many of the applications, the vulnerability\nexists in the source code of SDKs they use. But some apps -- Evernote, IRS2Go, and MyTaxRefund --\nare vulnerable due to issues in their own source code.\n\n2.Medium-risk flaws\n\nA total of three apps\u2014two of them iOS and one Android\u2014display a combination of behaviors that\nAppthority determines are serious enough to put them in the medium-risk category. These behaviors\ninclude accessing privacy-invasive information on the mobile device, and not adequately\u00a0encrypting\nsensitive data. The flaws could potentially put user data at risk in certain situations. For\ninstance, people doing their taxes in a public Wi-Fi setting like a coffee shop could have their\ndata intercepted and stolen as a result of weak encryption.\n\n\u201cIf an app is transmitting information without encryption, then anyone in the same network can read\nand intercept that data,\u201d says Domingo Guerra, co-founder of Appthority. \u201cWhen the attacker sees a\n[unique device ID] go through, they could take advantage of a well-known vulnerability in TrueCaller\nto intercept [the ID]\u201d and grab personal data belonging to the user, he says. \u201cBecause not all apps\nhandle encryption correctly, users should avoid using apps that touch or transmit sensitive data\nwhen on a public or insecure Wi-Fi connection.\u201d\n\nTwo of the applications\u2014MyBlock and IRS2Go\u2014landed in this category for sharing the user\u2019s location\ndata in the clear without any encryption. The other app with a medium-risk flaw is CPA Tax Answers\nFree, which Appthority faults for sending certain tax-related data unencrypted.\n\n3. High-risk flaws.\n\nAppthority\u2019s highest risk category was reserved for mobile tax applications that store or transmit\nsensitive and personally identifiable data, including unique device identifier information, without\nencryption. Just three apps out of the 29 apps in the study fall into this category: the Android\nversion of MyBlock, which transmits device ID and PII unencrypted; the Android version of Calculator\nfor US Taxes, which sends unencrypted PII; and the iOS version of TaxBot, which transmits device ID\ninformation insecurely.\n\nThe likelihood of the flaws being exploited is relatively low, accordind to Appthority, but the\ncompany recommends avoiding public Wi-Fi and using a secure, password-protected network when filing\ntaxes via mobile apps.\n\nRelated content:\n\nFind out more about security threats at Interop 2016, May 2-6, at the Mandalay Bay Convention\nCenter, Las Vegas.

The malware exploits a\nkernel base mapping vulnerability, a kernel memory corruption flaw and a flaw in the Safari WebKit\nthat basically lets an attacker compromise an iOS device by getting the user to click on a single\nlink.\n\nAll three are zero-days flaws, which Apple has addressed via its 9.3.5 patch. The researchers are\nurging iOS users to apply the patch as soon as possible.\n\nPegasus, according to the security researchers, is highly configurable and is designed to spy on SMS\ntext messages, calls, emails, logs and data from applications like Facebook, Gmail, Skype, WhatsApp\nand Viber running on iOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe kit appears to persist even when the device software is updated and can update itself to easily\nreplace exploits if they become obsolete,\u201d the researchers said in their alert.\n\nEvidence suggests that Pegasus has been used to conduct so-called \u2018lawful intercepts\u2019 of iOS owners\nby governments and government-backed entities. The malware kit has been used to spy on a noted human\nrights activist in the United Arab Emirates, a Mexican journalist who reported on government\ncorruption and potentially several individuals in Kenya, the security researchers said.\n\nThe malware appears to emphasize stealth very heavily and the authors have gone to considerable\nefforts to ensure that the source remains hidden. \u201cCertain Pegasus features are only enabled when\nthe device is idle and the screen is off, such as \u2018environmental sound recording\u2019 (hot mic) and\n\u2018photo taking\u2019,\u201d the researchers noted.\n\nThe spyware also includes a self-destruct mechanism, which can activate automatically when there is\na probability that it will be discovered.\n\nLike many attacks involving sophisticated malware, the Pegasus attack sequence starts with a\nphishing text\u2014in this case a link in an SMS message\u2014which when clicked initiates a sequence of\nactions leading to device compromise and installation of malware.\n\nBecause of the level of sophistication required to find and exploit iOS zero-day vulnerabilities,\nexploit chains like Trident can fetch a lot of money in the black and gray markets, the researchers\nfrom Citizen Lab and Lookout said. As an example they pointed to an exploit chain similar to\nTrident, which sold for $1 million last year.\n\nThe second report describing vulnerabilities in IOS this week came from researchers at the North\nCarolina State University, TU Darmstadt, a research university in Germany and University Politehnica\nin Bucharest.\n\nIn a paper to be presented at an upcoming security conference in Vienna, the researchers said they\nfocused on iOS\u2019 sandbox feature to see if they could find any security vulnerabilities that could be\nexploited by third-party applications. The exercise resulted in the researchers unearthing multiple\nvulnerabilities that would enable adversaries to launch different kinds of attacks on iOS devices\nvia third-party applications.\n\nAmong them were attacks that would let someone bypass iOS\u2019 privacy setting for contacts, gain access\nto a user\u2019s location search history, and prevent access to certain system resources. In an alert, a\nresearcher who co-authored the paper said that the vulnerabilities have been disclosed to Apple,\nwhich is now working on fixing them.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n", "polarity": 0.06415701415701416, "subjectivity": 0.45622908622908626, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/09/apple-releases-fix-for-critical-java-flaws/", "date": "2012-09-05T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Apple Releases Fix for Critical Java Flaw", "body": "Apple has issued an update for Mac OS X installations of Java that fixes at least one critical\nsecurity vulnerability in the software.\n\nIf you own a Mac, take a moment today to run the Software Update application and check if there is a\nJava update available.

This failure on Apple\u2019s part\nfinally caught up with Mac OS X users earlier this year and turned into a major embarrassment for\nApple, when the Flashback malware infected more than 650,000 Mac systems using a vulnerability that\nOracle (but not Apple) had patched roughly two months earlier.\n\nWell, it seems that Apple learned a thing or two from that incident. The update Oracle released\nyesterday, Java 6 Update 33 and Java 7 Update 5, fixes at least 14 security flaws in the oft-\nattacked software that is installed on more than three billion devices worldwide. Apple\u2019s Java\nupdate brings Java on the Mac to 1.6.0_33, and patches 11 of the 14 security vulnerabilities that\nOracle fixed in Tuesday\u2019s release. It\u2019s unclear whether those other three flaws simply don\u2019t exist\nin the Mac version of Java, but we\u2019ll take progress where we can get it.\n\nRegardless of which operating system you use, if you have Java installed, I would advise you to\nupdate it, neuter it or remove it as soon as possible. The reason I say this is that Java requires\nconstant patching, and it appears to be the favorite target of attackers these days.\n\nWindows users can find out if they have Java installed and which version by visiting java.com and\nclicking the \u201cDo I have Java? link. Mac users can use the Software Update feature to check for any\navailable Java updates.\n\nIf you primarily use Java because some Web site, or program you have on your system \u2014 such as\nOpenOffice or Freemind \u2014 requires it, you can still dramatically reduce the risk from Java attacks\njust by disabling the plugin in your Web browser.

Adobe issued a patch that corrects four vulnerabilities in Shockwave Player,\nwhile Redmond pushed updates to address four Windows flaws. Apple slipped out an update that mends\nat least 17 security holes in its version of Java, and Mozilla issued yet another major Firefox\nrelease, Firefox 8.\n\nThe only \u201ccritical\u201d patch from Microsoft this month is a dangerous Windows flaw that could be\ntriggered remotely to install malicious software just by sending the target system specially crafted\npackets of data. Microsoft says this vulnerability may be difficult to reliably exploit, but it\nshould be patched immediately. Information on the other three flaws fixed this week is here. The\nfixes are available via Windows Updates for most supported versions of the operating system,\nincluding XP, Vista and Windows 7.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Shockwave update also fixes critical flaws, but users should check to see if they have this\nprogram installed before trying to update it. To test whether you have Shockwave installed, visit\nthis page; if you see an animation, it\u2019s time to update. If you see a prompt to install Shockwave,\nthere is no need to install it. Mozilla Firefox users without Shockwave Player installed may still\nsee \u201cShockwave Flash\u201d listed in the \u201cPlugins\u201d directory of the browser; this merely indicates that\nthe user has Adobe\u2019s Flash Player installed.\n\nThe vulnerabilities fixed by this update exist in versions of Shockwave 11.6.1.629 and earlier.

What\u2019s\nmore, like Adobe\u2019s Flash Player, Shockwave demands two separate installation procedures for IE and\nnon-IE browsers.\n\nHat tip to the SANS Internet Storm Center for the heads up on the Java fix from Apple. This update,\navailable via Software Update or Apple Downloads, essentially brings Snow Leopard and Lion up to\ndate with the Oracle patches released last month in Java 6 Update 29 (Apple maintains its own\nversion of Java).\n\nIf you use Mozilla Firefox or Thunderbird, you may have noticed that Mozilla is pushing out another\nmajor upgrade that includes critical fixes to these programs; both have now been updated to version\n8. If you\u2019re still running Firefox version 3.6.x, Mozilla has updated that to 3.6.24 (if anyone can\nhelp decipher Mozilla\u2019s timeline for exactly how long it will continue to support this workhorse\nversion of Firefox, please drop a line in the comments below). Perhaps I\u2019m becoming a curmudgeon,\nbut I\u2019m growing weary of the incessant update prompts from Firefox. It seems that almost every time\nI start it up it\u2019s asking to restart the browser or to remove plugins that no longer work with the\nlatest version. I\u2019ve been gradually transitioning more of my work over to Google Chrome, which seems\nfaster and updates the browser and any installed plugins silently (and frequently patches oft-\ntargeted plugins like Flash Player even before Adobe officially releases the update).\n\n", "polarity": 0.1083011583011583, "subjectivity": 0.5306842556842557, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/10/critical-security-updates-from-microsoft-apple/", "date": "2011-10-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Critical Security Updates from Microsoft, Apple", "body": "Microsoft and Apple today released security updates to fix a slew of critical security problems in\ntheir software.

Apple said the order violates its First Amendment\nrights\u2014software code is considered a form of free speech\u2014and reiterates points made by its CEO Tim\nCook that the FBI and the U.S. government would not stop at demanding access to just Syed Farook\u2019s\niPhone 5c. \n\n\u201cIn short, the government wants to compel Apple to create a crippled and insecure product,\u201d Apple\nattorneys wrote. \u201cOnce the process is created, it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign\nagents to access millions of iPhones. And once developed for our government, it is only a matter of\ntime before foreign governments demand the same tool.\u201d \n\nApple was given until today to respond to a federal magistrate\u2019s order of Feb. 16 that it build a\none-off version of iOS that would bypass security mechanisms protecting the shooter\u2019s 5c. The FBI\nasked for the ability to have a computer guess the phone\u2019s passcode. Currently, security on the\ndevice requires manually entered guesses and inserts an escalating time lag between incorrect\nguesses before eventually wiping the phone after 10 failed tries. \n\nThe court order asked Apple to build new firmware that would disable those protections, and insists\nthis is a one-time request. \n\nEarlier this week, however, Apple attorney Marc J. Zwillinger unsealed a document that showed a\ndozen similar requests from law enforcement to Apple asking for help in unlocking suspects\u2019 iPhones\nor iPads. The document was filed in an effort to show undue burden placed on Apple by the federal\nmagistrate\u2019s order. \n\nApple called the FBI\u2019s request a backdoor and said in Thursday\u2019s motion that the new firmware is\n\u201ctoo dangerous to build.\u201d \n\n\u201cIf this order is permitted to stand, it will only be a matter of days before some other prosecutor,\nin some other important case, before some other judge, seeks a similar order using this case as\nprecedent,\u201d Apple\u2019s attorney\u2019s wrote in the motion. \u201cOnce the floodgates open, they cannot be\nclosed, and the device security that Apple has worked so tirelessly to achieve will be unwound\nwithout so much as a congressional vote.\u201d \n\nApple also made the case that the backdoor introduces a vulnerability that could be exploited not\njust by law enforcement but also by criminals. It also pointed out that even if the requested\nfirmware could be limited to just domestic terrorism cases, that criminals would seek to encrypt\ncommunication developed outside the U.S. that could not be \u201cconscripted\u201d by the U.S. government. \n\nThe pretext for the original court order is the All Writs Act of 1789, which Cook said earlier this\nweek opens the door to a dangerous expansion of the FBI\u2019s authority. Apple\u2019s attorneys reiterated\nthis point in Thursday\u2019s motion: \n\n\u201cGiven the government\u2019s boundless interpretation of the All Writs Act, it is hard to conceive of any\nlimits on the orders the government could obtain in the future,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor example, if Apple\ncan be forced to write code in this case to bypass security features and create new accessibility,\nwhat is to stop the government from demanding that Apple write code to turn on the microphone in aid\nof government surveillance, activate the video camera, surreptitiously record conversations, or turn\non location services to track the phone\u2019s user?

The devices in question are mostly iPhones, including two iPhone 3 devices running very\nold versions of iOS that lack many of the security mechanisms in place on later versions, including\nFarook\u2019s 5c. Four of the requests, however, are to unlock iPhone 6 or 6 Plus devices that include\nSecure Enclave and strong encryption that are hampering the FBI in unlocking the terror suspect\u2019s\ndevice. \n\nZwillinger\u2019s note reaffirms Apple\u2019s opposition to last week\u2019s order. \n\nThe unsealed document appeared on the heels of a public appeal on Sunday from FBI Director James\nComey, who denied the order is an attempt to set a precedent. As in other arguments against Going\nDark, the government and law enforcement\u2019s term for its inability to extract evidence from encrypted\ndevices despite having court order permitting them to do so, Comey played on the emotional aspects\nof the argument. \n\n\u201cFourteen people were slaughtered and many more had their lives and bodies ruined. We owe them a\nthorough and professional investigation under law. That\u2019s what this is. The American people should\nexpect nothing less from the FBI,\u201d Comey wrote in a public letter. \n\nApple no longer holds the encryption keys to unlock user its phones and tablets, instead has moved\nthem to the devices. This means that Apple cannot be compelled via court orders to hand them over. \n\nLast week\u2019s court order, granted by Judge Sheri Pym, mandates Apple assist in cracking Farook\u2019s\nfour-digit passcode. Security mechanisms on the phone implement, with each incorrect guess, a lag\nthat grows between incorrect guesses and eventually after 10 incorrect guesses, the phone will be\nwiped. The FBI wants the data on the device to aid in its investigation of the shooting and any\nalleged terrorism contacts Farook may have stored on the device. \n\n\u201cWe simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist\u2019s passcode without\nthe phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That\u2019s\nit,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\nI hope thoughtful people will take the time to understand that.\u201d \n\nCook has been silent since his initial objection to the court order when he called the FBI\u2019s actions\na dangerous expansion of its authority under the All Writs Act. \n\n\u201cThe implications of the government\u2019s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs\nAct to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone\u2019s device\nto capture their data,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe government could extend this breach of privacy and demand\nthat Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or\nfinancial data, track your location, or even access your phone\u2019s microphone or camera without your\nknowledge. \n\n\u201cOpposing this order is not something we take lightly,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe feel we must speak up in the\nface of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.051340752743191755, "subjectivity": 0.35558043582433824, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-must-forever-threat-model-against-itself/116473/", "date": "2016-02-25T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple Must Forever Threat Model Against Itself", "body": "Apple, like most advanced tech companies, understands threats and how to close them off. But one\nsalient point that\u2019s emerged from its ongoing dispute with the FBI over unlocking the San Bernardino\nshooter\u2019s phone is that Apple is a threat to itself. Therefore, it should be no surprise that Apple\nengineers are already reportedly working on iPhone security updates that\u00a0take into account Apple as\npart of its threat model. \n\nMeanwhile, the war of words between Apple and the FBI escalated again last night when CEO Tim Cook\nappeared on ABC News and likened the government\u2019s request to write new firmware that would bypass\nexisting security on the device as \u201cthe software equivalent of cancer.\u201d Cook reiterated that Apple\u2019s\ndefiant stance is about fending off the precedent that meeting such a demand would create. The\ngovernment would have at its disposal a mechanism for similarly unlocking devices in perpetuity not\njust for national security cases, but also for lesser-profile criminal cases. This is largely\nbecause Apple currently has the ability to update firmware without the need for the user to enter\ntheir passcode onto the phone. \n\nJonathan Zdziarski, a noted iOS forensics expert, told Threatpost that he expects Apple to close\nthis off in short order, as well as shore up the Secure Enclave, which protects newer versions of\nthe iPhone by brokering access to encryption keys for services on the device that require\nencryption. He believes Apple\u2019s threat model will include itself going forward. \n\n\u201cThey probably will shore up Secure Enclave so that it doesn\u2019t accept new firmware without being\nunlocked first. Minor tweaks to Secure Enclave should be enough to keep Apple out without going to\nextreme efforts to break in,\u201d Zdziarski said. \u201cOnce you get past being able to write and sign your\nown firmware, you have to get in with electron microscopes and look at the fuse array where the\nDevice ID encryption is based. You have to get to deep logic levels to the point where you\u2019re\nmessing with silicon.\u201d \n\nZdziarski wrote a post to his personal website on Wednesday describing 13 iOS security improvements\nApple should consider, among those would be a modification to the DFU, or Device Firmware Upgrade,\nthat it\u2019s destructive and drops the encryption keys before loading an image unless the phone has\nbeen unlocked by the user. He also advocates that Apple encrypt backup data sent to iCloud with keys\nderived from the user\u2019s alphanumeric backup password. \n\n\u201cThe iPhone (6) today, I think is reasonably secure the way it is. The only reason we are having\nthis conversation at all is that the subject was lax enough in their security practices to use a\nweak passcode,\u201d Zdziarski said in reference to suspect Syed Farook, whose four-digit numeric code\nguards the data on the iPhone 5c coveted by the FBI. Zdziarski points out that a six-character\nalphanumeric passcode would take years to crack with a modern computer, and an 11-character code\nmore than 100 years. \u201cThis is the classic encryption problem. The strength of the password is still\ngoing to determine the strength of the security on the device. Even if the FBI got Apple to remove\nall the security features from the device today, the key derivation alone will render that\nencryption infeasible to break if they had used a good passcode.\u201d \n\nThe FBI hopes to crack the device in order to learn whether Farood had any other contacts or\ninformation that could be useful in this investigation or others related to national security and\nterrorism. Last week, a federal magistrate ordered Apple to assist the FBI by writing new firmware\nthat would bypass security features such as the introduction of a significant and escalating time\nlag between incorrect guesses of the passcode, as well as the wiping of the device after 10\nincorrect tries. The FBI hopes to compel Apple to write new firmware that would also allow them to\nuse a computer to generate guesses and brute-force the device. While the FBI and the court insists\nthis is a one-time request, Apple attorney Marc Zwillinger two days ago unsealed a document sent to\nthe court that revealed a dozen similar requests made to Apple by the government in cases of varying\nseverity. Apple has objected to 10 of those requests\u2014made since October\u2014and is awaiting more\ndocumentation in two other requests. \n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s bad news to write (the new firmware). We would never write it. We have never written\nit,\u201d Cook said, acknowledging the complexity and emotions involved. \u201cIt is about the future. Think\nabout this: If a court compels Apple to write this piece of software, to place a backdoor in the\niPhone, we believe it does put hundreds of millions of customers at risk.\u201d \n\nZdziarski said he believes Apple would bring this to the Supreme Court if need be, and that Congress\nshould intervene at some point given that the American people have not been represented in this\ndebate to date. \n\n\u201cThis is high profile enough that at some point, the heat of it all this is going to back the FBI\noff this, or it will get taken as high up as it can go and we\u2019ll see some kind of decision based on\nthat,\u201d he said. \n\nApple was given five days to respond to the court order, and that runs out tomorrow. \n\n\u201cThis is not a position that we would like to be in, it is a very uncomfortable position,\u201d Cook\nsaid. \u201cTo oppose your government on something doesn\u2019t feel good. And to oppose it on something where\nwe are advocating for civil liberties which they are supposed to protect it is incredibly ironic.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.09726041200179134, "subjectivity": 0.4881833109419315, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/experts-doubt-hackers-claim-of-millions-of-breached-apple-credentials/124574/", "date": "2017-03-25T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Experts Doubt Hackers\u2019 Claim Of Millions Of Breached Apple Credentials", "body": "Security experts say they are skeptical that a group of hackers called Turkish Crime Family actually\npossess a cache of hundreds of millions of Apple iCloud account credentials. A more plausible\nexplanation, they say, is that crooks used credential stuffing attacks to amass a limited number of\nvalid Apple usernames and passwords in attempt to extort money from Apple. \n\nEarlier this week, the group identifying itself as the Turkish Crime Family claimed to have a\ndatabase of 750 million iCloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses and credentials. Apple\nquickly cast doubts on the claim. \n\n\u201cThere have not been any breaches in any of Apple\u2019s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,\u201d Apple\nsaid in a statement. \u201cThe alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been\nobtained from previously compromised third-party services.\u201d \n\nHackers behind the claim are demanding Apple pay them $75,000 in cryptocurrency or give them\n$100,000 in iTunes vouchers, according to reports. If\u00a0 demands are not met by April 7, the group\nsaid it will begin deleting data stored on iCloud accounts en masse. \n\nAn independent analysis of 54 samples of the breached account data provided to ZDNet by the hackers\nwere valid. However, security experts such as Troy Hunt, who runs the data breach repository\nHaveIBeenPwned.com, still isn\u2019t convinced. \n\nHunt told Threatpost he suspects the hack is a hoax, admitting he has not seen the any samples of\nthe breached data. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible whoever is behind this could have username and password pairs that work on a\nlimited number of Apple accounts in just the same way as re-used credentials will work across all\nsorts of other accounts,\u201d Hunt said. He said the Turkish Crime Family likely has a far smaller pool\nof valid Apple credentials than it claims. \n\nShuman Ghosemajumder, CTO of the firm Shape Security told Threatpost he suspects the hackers may\nhave used credential stuffing attacks, using data from previous breaches, to gain access to an\nundetermined number of iCloud accounts. \n\nCredential stuffing is the use of automated brute-forcing tools such as Sentry MBA to test stolen\npasswords against other unrelated websites. Shape Security estimates that last year alone 3.3\nbillion credentials were exposed via breaches. Despite credential stuffing\u2019s low success rate of \u00a01\npercent to 2 percent, Ghosemajumder said, when applied to a large enough cache of data (purchased on\nthe dark web by the database) the hackers may have enough information to successfully crack\nthousands of Apple accounts. \n\n\u201cThere are certainly enough credentials spilled onto the internet to think someone could use\ncredential stuffing techniques to pull together a convincing number of valid accounts in attempt to\nextort Apple for ransom money,\u201d Ghosemajumder said. \n\nPatrick Wardle, director of research at Synack, echoed the same credential theory suggesting that\nbreaches over the past year have given hackers ample opportunity to pull together some valid iCloud\naccount credentials. \n\nSince approaching Apple earlier this month with its demands, the Turkish Crime Family has been\ninconsistent about how many account credentials it allegedly possesses. Speaking to various\ndifferent media outlets, the group has said it had 200 million credentials to as many as 750\nmillion. \n\nThe hacking group said\u00a0that its repository isn\u2019t the result of one breach, rather multiple. \n\n\u201cThe entire DB was acquired and built from multiple DB\u2019s that we have been selling in the past 5\nyears as we decided to keep all our @icloud.com, @me.com & mac.com domains\u2026 More and more people\nstarted getting involved after all the press release world wide, these people have been providing us\neven more databases which we did not already have,\u201d according to a message allegedly posted by the\nhackers to the website Meethackers. \n\nOn Thursday, the group claimed to have a database of 750 million credentials, 250 million of which\nare \u201cchecked and working,\u201d according to the group. \n\nMeanwhile, Apple says it\u2019s actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and\nis working with law enforcement to identify the criminals behind the Turkish Crime Family extortion\nscheme. \n\n", "polarity": 0.0349647266313933, "subjectivity": 0.41693121693121704, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-fixes-223-vulnerabilities-across-macos-ios-safari/124599/", "date": "2017-03-28T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Apple Fixes 223 Vulnerabilities Across macOS, iOS, Safari", "body": "Apple fixed hundreds of bugs, 223 to be exact, across a slate of products including macOS Sierra,\niOS, Safari, watchOS, and tvOS on Monday. \n\nMore than a quarter\u00a0of the bugs, 40 in macOS Sierra, and 30 in iOS, could lead to arbitrary code\nexecution \u2013 in some instances with root privileges, Apple warned. \n\nThe lion\u2019s share of the vulnerabilities patched Monday, 127 in total, were fixed in the latest\nversion of macOS Sierra, 10.12.4. \n\nIan Beer, a researcher with Google\u2019s Project Zero group, uncovered seven of the vulnerabilities,\nincluding six that could have enabled an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel\nprivileges. South Korean hacker Jung Hoon Lee, perhaps better known in hacking circles\u00a0by\u00a0his handle\nLokihardt, is credited for finding two vulnerabilities as well \u2013 one in the kernel and one in\nWebKit. Lokihardt, a veteran of Pwn2Own competitions, joined Project Zero in December 2016. \n\nThe update also fixed a memory corruption issue that stemmed from how certificates were parsed. The\nbug, technically a use-after-free vulnerability, existed in the X.509 certificate validation\nfunctionality present in macOS and iOS. According to Aleksandar Nikolic, a researcher with Cisco\u2019s\nTalos Security Intelligence and Research Group\u00a0who found the bug, an attacker with a specially\ncrafted X.509 certificate could have triggered it and carried out remote code execution. Nikolic\nclaims a victim could either be tricked several ways \u2013 a user could get served a malicious cert via\na website, by the Mail app connecting to a mail server that contains a malicious cert, or by opening\na malicious cert to import into the keychain. \n\nTalos claims\u00a0it verified the most recent versions of macOS Sierra, 10.12.3, and iOS, 10.2.1, are\nvulnerable. Older versions of the operating systems are likely affected too, the firm claims. \n\nPer usual, a\u00a0large chunk of vulnerabilities in the OS were addressed by updating open source\nsoftware implementations that macOS uses to the next version. Forty-one different bugs were fixed by\nupdating tcpdump, a free packet analyzer, to version 4.9.0. 11 vulnerabilities were fixed by\nupdating LibreSSL and PHP to versions 2.4.25 and 5.6.30 respectively. Four vulnerabilities were\naddressed by updating OpenSSH in macOS to version 7.4. \n\nOne of the vulnerabilities fixed in iOS pertains to how the mobile version of Safari handled\nJavaScript pop ups. Researchers with Lookout Security found the bug and claim it was being leveraged\nby attackers to trick victims into thinking they were locked out of browser. Code created by the\nattackers creates a popup window, which infinitely loops until the victim pays money in the form of\niTunes gift cards. \n\nCode used in the attack was previously published on a Russian website and reused to essentially\nperform a denial of service (DOS) attack on the browser, Lookout claims. \n\nAccording to the iOS advisory, the update also does away with the DES cryptographic algorithm for\nProfiles. In its place Apple has added support for the 3DES algorithm. While its been superseded by\nAES in some systems, 3DES is viewed as secure enough for most purposes today. DES, now widely\nconsidered insecure, was approved for withdrawal by the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology back in 2005. \n\nApple also fixed 38 bugs, 23 that could have led to arbitrary code execution, in its Safari browser\non Monday. The rest of the bugs could led to a variety of issues, universal cross site scripting,\nthe exfiltration of data cross-origin, application termination, and spoofing. \n\nNearly all of the bugs, 30 of them, existed\u00a0in WebKit, the web browser engine used by Safari.\nDetails on bugs uncovered by\u00a0Project Zero researchers like Ivan Fratric, lokihardt, and Natalie\nSilvanovich have been published on the team\u2019s Chromium bugtracker: \n\nI \u2764\ufe0f these bugshttps://t.co/xuuA6OzSqDhttps://t.co/IKw6qNuTurhttps://t.co/H5jjnzAaKV \n\n\u2014 Natalie Silvanovich (@natashenka) March 27, 2017 \n\n \n\nA bug that affected three programs in iWork \u2013 Pages, Numbers, and Keynote \u2013 was also fixed by Apple\nthis week. Because the office suite used a weak 40-but RC4 encryption scheme for password-protected\nPDFs, an attacker could have broken into files thought to be secure. Apple remedied the issue by\nchanging iWork export so it uses AES-128. It\u2019s unclear why Apple was using such a low level of\nsecurity. Recent advances in computing technology has left 40-bit encryption in the dust; academics\nwith UC Berkeley even went as far as to call the standard obsolete back in 1997. \n\nApple Releases Security Update for iWork https://t.co/0svDnkFy7o \n\n\u2014 US-CERT (@USCERT_gov) March 27, 2017 \n\n \n\nSeveral bugs in Apple\u2019s television operating system tvOS, and smart watch operating system, watchOS,\nwere also patched this week. As the operating systems share much of the same code as\u00a0iOS, many\u00a0of\nthe vulnerabilities listed in the advisories overlap. \n\nWhile the patches mark one of Apple\u2019s largest updates in a while, none of Monday\u2019s patches appear to\nresolve vulnerabilities uncovered by this month\u2019s Pwn2Own hacking competition. \n\nWhile many of the bugs fixed were identified by researchers from Tencent Security and Qihoo 360 who\nfound critical bugs in Vancouver three weeks ago, none of them made their way into this week\u2019s\npatches. \n\nHackers with Chaitin Security Research Lab took down Safari with the help of an information\ndisclosure bug, four different type confusion bugs, and a use-after-free in WindowServer. The group\nalso used an info leak and an out of bounds bug in the operating system\u2019s kernel on the second day.\nTwo German hackers, Samuel Gro\u00df and Niklas Baumstark, also hacked macOS, elevating to root privilege\nby chaining together a use-after-free in Safari, three logic bugs and a null pointer dereference.\nApple told Gro\u00df and Baumstark at Pwn2Own that it had fixed the use-after-free in a beta version of\nthe browser but it\u2019s unclear when the fix will go live. \n\nApple fixed one use-after-free issue this week in Safari\u2019s WebKit, dug up by Fratric, but it\u2019s\nunclear if it\u2019s the same one the two German hackers used. \n\nApple was targeted multiple times over the course of the Pwn2Own. Hackers with Qihoo\u2019s 360 Security\nalso exploited Safari with an integer overflow, and escalated to root through a macOS kernel use-\nafter-free on the second day. The team also used an info leak and race condition in macOS\u2019 kernel to\nexploit the operating system. Judging from Apple\u2019s advisory, none of the bugs appear to be fixed\nyet. \n\n", "polarity": 0.05622180210787804, "subjectivity": 0.3219208358448864, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/malware-that-targets-both-microsoft-apple-operating-systems-found/124531/", "date": "2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Malware That Targets Both Microsoft, Apple Operating Systems Found", "body": "Researchers came across a malicious Word document last week that doesn\u2019t discriminate between OS\nplatforms. The malicious Word document is designed to spread malware on either Mac OS X or Microsoft\nWindows, depending on where it\u2019s opened. \n\nLike many other strains of malware these days, the sample, which researchers at Fortinet observed\u00a0on\nMarch 16, relies on tricking users into enabling macros. \n\nOnce opened and macros are enabled, malicious VBA, or Visual Basic for Applications, code is\nexecuted, which runs the AutoOpen() macro. The macro goes on to read a base64-encoded string in the\nfile, which depending on the operating system, executes a certain script. \n\nFor victims running Mac OS X, the script, is fairly straightforward. It downloads a malicious file\ncontaining another script, written in python, that\u2019s executed and attempts to communicate with the\nattacker\u2019s server.\u00a0The downloaded script is a modded version of a Python meterpreter file,\nresearchers say. \n\nMeterpreter, part of the Metasploit framework, is extensible payload component that uses in-memory\nDLL injection stagers.\u00a0The tool has been adopted by several groups of late, including GCMAN and a\ngroup of attackers who have been spotted carrying out\u00a0fileless malware-based attacks. \n\nThe script that triggers the exploit on Windows is a little more involved. Like a Russian nesting\ndoll, one layer of base64-encoded data spawns a powershell script, which decompresses another layer\nof base-64-encoded code which leads to another powershell script. Once executed, the script finally\ndownloads a 64-bit DLL file, which executes and communicates with the attacker\u2019s server. Researchers\nwith Fortinet believe the Windows side of the malware only affects 64-bit versions of Windows. \n\nWhile they have a pretty good idea of how the malware spreads, researchers\u00a0aren\u2019t completely sure\nwhat the attackers behind it were after. Peixue Li, senior manager of FortiGuard Service Development\nand Security Research told Threatpost Thursday that when they observed TCP sessions to the\nattacker\u2019s server \u2013 both Windows and Apple \u2013 the server\u00a0wasn\u2019t answering. Instead, Wireshark just\ngave them a TCP retransmission error message. \n\nMacro malware that explicitly targets macOS isn\u2019t necessarily new \u2013 but it has been a recent\ndevelopment. Researchers with Synack came across macro malware that executes solely on Mac machines\nback in February. \n\nThat malware, peddled by a group whose IP traces back to Russia, operated in a similar fashion. The\nvictim would have to agree to enable macros for a Word document on the Mac version of Word. After\nenabled, a macro decodes data, and like the malware Fortinet researchers found, executes it in\nPython. The malware Synack found relies on leveraging a legitimate python post-exploitation OS X and\nLinux agent, EmPyre. \n\nFortinet\u2019s researchers claim they\u2019re still analyzing the malware, but Li says\u00a0the fact that the\nmalware\u2019s Python post-exploitation agent is different than the one used by the malware seen by\nSynack separates it from a pack. \n\n\u201cThe malware we analyzed targets both Mac OS and Windows\u2026 the Python post-exploitation agent used by\nthe malware is different. One is EmPyre, the other is Meterpreter, Li said, \u201cCross-platform Macro-\nbased malware could become a trend, perhaps.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.07270923520923521, "subjectivity": 0.42709368820479937, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-patches-critical-kernel-vulnerabilities/123272/", "date": "2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple Patches Critical Kernel Vulnerabilities", "body": "Apple today released new versions of iOS and macOS Sierra and addressed some overlapping code\nexecution vulnerabilities in both its mobile and desktop operating systems. \n\nThe updates were part of a bigger release of security updates from Apple that also included Safari,\niCloud for Windows, and watchOS. \n\nThe most critical of the bugs were a pair of kernel vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-2370 and\nCVE-2017-2360, which could allow a malicious application to execute code with the highest kernel\nprivileges.

Eight of the bugs could lead to a denial of service\ncondition. Information around one of the nastier bugs, dug up by Ian Beer of Google\u2019s project Zero,\nin macOS\u2019 kernel, is scant. But according to Apple\u2019s advisory, if exploited, it could have led to\ncode execution in the kernel, or system termination. Beer found nine of the bugs fixed by Apple on\nTuesday, four of them in the kernel. \n\nThe update includes fixes for Apple frameworks such as\u00a0CoreGraphics and IO, volume management\nsystems like CoreStorage. It also updates versions of PHP (5.6.26) and the file transfer library,\ncURL, (7.51.0). \n\nAn audit\u00a0(.PDF) carried out by the German penetration firm Cure53, sponsored by Mozilla\u2019s Secure\nOpen Source program, late last month identified a dozen vulnerabilities in the cURL libary. Apple\nfixed those bugs and warned that an attacker in a privileged network position could have exploited\nthem to leak sensitive user information. \n\nOther vulnerabilities that could have allowed an attacker to modify downloaded mobile assets, or in\none instance, gain root privileges, were also fixed with the macOS update. \n\nIncluded in the macOS update is the latest version of Safari, 10.0.2. The update fixes 24 issues in\nthe browser, most which affect WebKit, Safari\u2019s web browser engine. Those bugs could have led to\ncode execution, the disclosure of process memory, the disclosure of user information, and the\nunexpected termination of the browser, Apple warns.

It did not set a new deadline. \n\nThe introduction of App Transport Security (ATS) has been a priority for Apple. At its Worldwide\nDevelopers Conference in 2015 it introduced ATS detailing the importance of the transport security\nstandards, explaining how the collection of technologies are designed to provide security for data\nthat\u2019s sent between iOS and macOS apps and back end servers.

The\ngovernment contends that by Apple not having direct access to user data, and thus cannot be\ncompelled via warrant or National Security Letter, to turn over content, the decision puts law\nenforcement at a disadvantage. Apple\u2014and security and privacy experts\u2014contend that the decision\nprotects not only user privacy, but also human rights for those in areas run by sanctioned\ngovernments or oppressive leaders. \n\n\u201cApple has really doubled down on privacy,\u201d said Matthew Green, crypto expert and professor at Johns\nHopkins University. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something they\u2019re just using for a temporary advantage. They\u2019ve\nactually spent a significant amount of effort thinking through the privacy and security implications\nof every part of their platform.\u201d \n\nThe new Apple privacy policy is actually a web portal that opens to a number of pages that catalog\nthe company\u2019s approach to privacy in its products, how users can defend themselves against online\nthreats to their sensitive information, as well as a link to government information requests, or the\ncompany\u2019s transparency report. \n\nThe approach-to-privacy page is a primer on encryption, and how Apple products and services make use\nof it to secure data. The page explains how Apple Pay secures transaction data, for example,\npointing out that payment card data is not stored on the device, nor on Apple\u2019s servers. The\nencryption of iMessage and FaceTime is also laid out in plain English, explaining how sessions are\nencrypted and cannot be accessed by Apple or anyone else without the user\u2019s passcode.

The report says a small fraction of requests seek content\nfrom iCloud accounts, for example. \n\nFrom the transparency report page: \n\n\u201cOn devices running iOS 8 and later versions, your personal data is placed under the protection of\nyour passcode.

It\u2019s also been a favorite target of researchers and advanced attackers\ndesperate to gain control of Apple devices. \n\nTomorrow at Virus Bulletin in Prague, researcher Patrick Wardle, director of research at Synack,\nwill demonstrate a Gatekeeper bypass he\u2019s been cooking up for some time. Wardle told Threatpost he\nhas shared his findings with Apple, which is reportedly working on a short-term mitigation until a\nfull patch can be pushed out to users. \n\nThe problem is that Wardle\u2019s bypass could require some re-architecting of the operating system to\nfully address the design weakness being exploited. \n\nGatekeeper performs a number of checks on apps before it allows one to execute on an Apple machine.\nFor example, it will not allow code to execute that\u2019s not signed with an Apple developer certificate\nor if it\u2019s not downloaded from the App Store. But what Gatekeeper fails to do, Wardle said, is check\nwhether an app runs or loads other apps or dynamic libraries from the same or relative directory. \n\nGatekeeper signs off only on the first static check and trusts the application is secure and\nbehaving accordingly. Wardle said that an attacker could trick the user into downloading a signed\nand infected app from a third-party source, or if in a man-in-the-middle position, for example,\ncould load a malicious library into the directory over an insecure HTTP download, and gain that\ninitial foothold onto the machine. \n\nIn the case of his exploit, Wardle found signed Apple binaries that he used to craft his attack,\nwhich would take the form of a DMG file (Apple disk image file) he tricks the user into downloading,\nfor example. The user is presented with a traditional app icon that when executed looks for the\nmalicious executable in the same DMG file and executes that. \n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not super complicated, but it effectively completely bypasses Gatekeeper,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cThis\nprovides hackers the ability to go back to their old tricks of infecting users via Trojans, rogue AV\nscams or infect applications on Pirate Bay. More worrisome to me is this would allow more\nsophisticated adversaries to have network access. Nation states with higher level access, they see\ninsecure downloads, they can swap in this legitimate Apple binary and this malicious binary as well\nand man-in-the-middle the attack and Gatekeeper won\u2019t protect users from it anymore.\u201d \n\nWardle, who demonstrated Apple dylib hijacking attacks at CanSecWest this year, said he tested his\nattack on Yosemite versions of OS X, but believes this affects all versions, including El Capitan,\nthe upcoming release. Wardle said his attack worked on the most recent beta version of El Capitan,\nreleased recently to developers and he was still able to bypass Gatekeeper. \n\n\u201cIn my opinion, Gatekeeper is a good idea. Apple touts it as one of the cornerstones of their\nsecurity posture as why Macs are more secure. But the reality is that sure Gatekeeper can protect\nna\u00efve users from lame attackers, but sophisticated adversaries, I don\u2019t think Gatekeeper is a\nstumbling block at all,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a bug, but a limitation of Gatekeeper. I\nthink fixing this requires significant code changes. It\u2019s not like they can just patch a buffer\noverflow with an extra check. This will take some significant changes.\u201d \n\nUntil Apple fixes the vulnerability, users should take care in download apps only from trusted\nsources and over HTTPS in order to ward off the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks. Wardle said\nhe\u2019s not aware of attacks similar to his being used in the wild, but cautioned that Gatekeeper isn\u2019t\nkeeping nation state adversaries awake at night. \n\nIronically, in the case of Wardle\u2019s attack, applications don\u2019t necessarily look for apps or\nlibraries in other directories; it\u2019s not common app behavior. He believes one way to approach fixing\nthis is for Apple to perform a runtime check when executables start or libraries are load that\ndetermines if it\u2019s from an untrusted source online or from Apple. \n\n\u201cIf the application or dynamic library is from the Internet, let\u2019s check to see if it conforms to\nthe users\u2019 settings, make sure it\u2019s signed or from the App Store. We could do that, and that would\ngenerically stop an attack,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cWhen the Apple trusted executable launches the second\nexecutable that is unsigned and untrusted, their runtime hook would detect that. They already have a\nframework in place where they\u2019re hooking runtime executions and examining things; I think they could\nextend it further to validate that.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.11496913580246915, "subjectivity": 0.5525205761316873, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-patches-quicktime-crash-and-code-execution-flaws/114375/", "date": "2015-08-21T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple Patches QuickTime Crash and Code Execution Flaws", "body": "Apple on Thursday pushed out a new version of QuickTime for Windows that patched nine\nvulnerabilities, including a handful reported Aug. 13 by Cisco Talos and Fortinet researchers. \n\nAll five flaws, if exploited, could lead to a crash of the media player or code execution in some\ncases, Apple said in its advisory.

The researchers disclosed a half-dozen\nvulnerabilities to Apple months ago, and some are patched while others remain on the drawing board. \n\nThe flaws have been patched on the reference implementation for UEFI on other Intel platforms. In\nthe case of Apple, the company has said in the past its firmware was not impacted; all the firmware\nin question, however, is derived from the same Intel reference implementation, the researchers said. \n\nApple\u2019s mobile iOS platform has been upgraded to version 8.4.1 and include the usual long list of\nWebKit code-execution, information (cookie) leakage, and Content Security Policy vulnerabilities. \n\nThe iOS update also includes patches for ImageIO, a library that provides an interface to read and\nwrite image data. Google researcher Michal Zalewski reported bugs in ImageIO where a malicious .TIFF\nfile could corrupt memory during processing and lead to code execution. The update also patches a\nproblem with ImageIO\u2019s handling of PNG images that could result, Apple said, in the disclosure of\nprocess memory to a website hosting an exploit. \n\nApple also updated its Safari browser, releasing versions 8.0.8, 7.1.8 and 6.2.8. Most of the\nvulnerabilities addressed in the update reside in WebKit and result in code execution or exposure of\ncookie information if exploited. \n\nThe OS X Server update to version 4.1.5 addresses a recently patched vulnerability in BIND that\ncould lead to server crashes. BIND patched the vulnerability in the way it handled TKEY queries,\nwhich was remotely exploitable, on July 29. The flaw affected all versions of BIND\u2019s DNS software\nfrom 9.1.0 through 9.9.7. The vulnerability is in the way that BIND handles certain queries related\nto transaction key records, and it affected recursive and authoritative servers. The bug is fixed in\nBIND versions 9.9.7-P2 and P3. \n\nBIND is the most widely deployed name server software on the Internet and the TKEY flaw is an\nespecially problematic one for administrators running name servers; its handlers at the Internet\nSystem Consortium said there is no real workaround, and defending against the bug can be quite\ndifficult. \n\nThis article was updated with clarifications around the Thunderstrike 2 patch. \n\n", "polarity": 0.034172679172679174, "subjectivity": 0.4611664261664261, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-patches-remote-invoice-vulnerability-in-itunes-app-store/113989/", "date": "2015-07-28T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Apple Patches Remote \u2018Invoice Vulnerability\u2019 in iTunes, App Store", "body": "Apple recently patched a serious issue in its App Store and iTunes Store web app that could have let\na remote attacker inject malicious script into invoices that come from Apple and subsequently lead\nto session hijacking, phishing, and redirect. \n\nThe vulnerability was unearthed in June by Benjamin Kunz Mejri, a researcher with Vulnerability Lab,\nand reported to the Cupertino conglomerate.

The bug, via a\ndirectory traversal attack, could theoretically allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on a\ntarget device. \n\nDowd told Threatpost Wednesday that Apple has released a mitigation for the bug, but hasn\u2019t\ntechnically patched it yet. \n\nNine issues were fixed in CFNetwork, a framework in Apple\u2019s Core Services framework, including bugs\nthat could have let an attacker decrypt data protected by SSL, intercept SSL/TLS connections, create\nunintended cookies for a website, bypass HTTP Strict Transport Security, and more.\u00a0Apple removed the\nfallback to SSL 3.0 \u2013 which only allows the unstable RC4 \u2013 in the framework to address\u00a0some of these\nissues.\u00a0The company also updated to the latest version of OpenSSL in iOS 9 \u00a0to solve what it calls\nmultiple vulnerabilities in older versions of the protocol. \n\nSeven issues in kernel were also addressed, including memory corruption bugs, weaknesses, and a bug\nthat could have let an attacker launch denial of service attacks on targeted TCP connections. \n\nElsewhere, six issues in Safari were fixed, including a problem that could have surfaced when a user\nvisited a malicious website that would\u2019ve led to user interface spoofing. Forensics expert Jonathan\nZdziarski stumbled upon a vulnerability in the browser that was remedied as well. Safari bookmark\ndata wasn\u2019t being encrypted properly, so a local user could have read bookmarks on a locked iOS\ndevice without a passcode. Now that data is being encrypted with a key bolstered by the hardware\nunique identifier number and the user\u2019s passcode. \n\nAn issue in Game Center was also fixed that could have been exploited as well.

The issue was addressed by increasing the default minimum size allowed for DH\nephemeral keys to 768 bits,\u201d the Apple advisory says. \n\nApple also patched an interesting bug that involved the way that iOS handles payloads from SIM\ncards. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a malicious SIM card that could give him\ncode execution on a target device. \n\nAmong the other vulnerabilities addressed in iOS 8.4 are a number of WebKit bugs, some\u00a0of which\ncould lead to arbitrary code execution. The code execution flaws include a pair of memory corruption\nvulnerabilities in WebKit, and an issue with the way the framework handled some SQL functions. \n\n\u201cAn insufficient comparison issue existed in SQLite authorizer which allowed invocation of arbitrary\nSQL functions. This issue was addressed with improved authorization checks,\u201d the Apple advisory\nsays. \n\nThere is a patch in the new version of iOS for a bug that could lead to an attacker being able to\nreplace a legitimate app with a malicious one under some conditions.

Sample table atoms contain the vulnerable stbl atom type. \n\n\u201cAn attacker who can control the data inside an stbl atom in a .MOV file can cause an undersized\nallocation which can lead to an out-of-bounds read,\u201d Cisco researcher wrote in their advisory. \u201cAn\nattacker can use this to create a use-after-free scenario that could lead to remote code execution.\u201d \n\nCraig Williams, security outreach manager at Cisco, said the vulnerability was discovered\n\u00a0internally by the company\u2019s Talos Vulnerability Research and Development Team and has not been\nexploited publicly. \n\n\u201cYou would see this type of vulnerability used by attackers in spam campaigns, phishing or\nmalvertising campaigns,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAny way where a user can be tricked into clicking on a link\nis how the vulnerability could be exploited.\u201d \n\nThis bug seems ripe in particular for exploit via malvertising or drive-by download, similar to how\na Flash zero-day is used in targeted attacks. Users are lured to a website hosting a malicious .mov\nfile that exploits the bug, or the exploit litters advertising on a legitimate website. \n\nCisco explains the technical details behind the vulnerability and the conditions that must be in\nplace to trigger the bug. \n\nDuring this spring\u2019s CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver, Cisco released a tool called\nFreeSentry that mitigates use-after-free bugs; FreeSentry is a plugin for the LLVM compiler.\nAccording to Bill Largent, one of the researchers who found the Apple bug, FreeSentry checks bounds\nin programs and notes where there could be code that runs out of bounds making it vulnerable to use-\nafter-free conditions. \n\n\u201cBuffer overflows are easier to detect through automated testing and security tools,\u201d Largent said.\n\u201cUse-after-free vulnerabilities are difficult to detect. They\u2019re not an obvious exploitable\ncondition.\u201d \n\nYesterday\u2019s QuickTime patch was one of dozens released on Tuesday by Apple, patching bugs in OS X,\niOS and the Safari browser. Apple iOS is now at version 8.4 and the latest update patched more than\n30 vulnerabilities in the iOS kernel, WebKit and CoreText. The Logjam vulnerability was also patched\nTuesday in iOS with a patch for the coreTLS system in the mobile OS. \n\nMany of the same bugs were patched in OS X, including a number of memory issues leading to code\nexecution, including the QuickTime patch. \n\n", "polarity": -0.019999999999999997, "subjectivity": 0.43022727272727274, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-moving-to-2fa-six-digit-passcodes-in-ios-9/113270/", "date": "2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Dennis Fisher", "title": "Apple Moving to 2FA, Six-Digit Passcodes in iOS 9", "body": "With each new release of iOS, Apple has been improving the security of the mobile operating system,\nadding new features, inserting exploit mitigations, and taking away avenues for attack. In the\nforthcoming iOS 9.0 release, the company is continuing this movement with the addition of two-factor\nauthentication and a number of other security features. \n\nLast year, in the wake of the hysteria surrounding the celebrity photo hacking scandal that involved\ntargeted attacks on iCloud accounts, Apple enabled two-factor authentication for the cloud storage\nservice. It also has turned it on for iTunes purchases. Now, Apple is enabling 2FA for users when\nthey sign into their Apple accounts from a new device or new browser. \n\n\u201cA password alone is not always enough to keep your account secure. With two-factor authentication,\nwhen you sign in from a new browser or on a new device, you\u2019ll be prompted for a verification code.\nThis code is automatically displayed on your other Apple devices or sent to your phone. Enter the\ncode and you\u2019re quickly signed in \u2014 and any unauthorized users are kept out,\u201d Apple said in the\nnotes for iOS 9. \n\nThe system that Apple employs for this is more like a two-step verification method than a true 2FA\nsystem, as it doesn\u2019t require a physical token or biometric identifier. But it adds another\nroadblock for attackers trying to take over users\u2019 accounts. \n\nApple also is changing the passcode strength from four digits to six, a move that it says ups the\nnumber of potential passcodes from 10,000 to one million. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t claim that this is a significant security improvement, it\u2019s not for an attacker that can\nmount an offline bruteforce attack on your phone.

Many companies, including Google,\nMicrosoft, Yahoo, and others have been moving their Web services to HTTPS by default over the last\ncouple of years. This movement has sped up since the disclosures about the National Security\nAgency\u2019s methods for eavesdropping on the Internet backbone and various services began in 2013. \n\nEven the federal government is getting in on the act. On Monday, Tony Scott, the federal CIO,\nannounced that all federal agencies must move their public Web sites and services to HTTPS-only by\nDec. 31, 2016. \n\nNow, Apple is nudging its huge community of mobile app developers in the same direction. The\ncompany\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference is going on this week, and as part of the upcoming release\nof iOS 9, Apple published some guidance about the changes in the new operating system. Part of that\nguidance explains the inclusion of Application Transport Security, a protocol that allows developers\nto force secure connections to specific domains from their apps. \n\n\u201cApp Transport Security (ATS) lets an app add a declaration to its Info.plist file that specifies\nthe domains with which it needs secure communication. ATS prevents accidental disclosure, provides\nsecure default behavior, and is easy to adopt. You should adopt ATS as soon as possible, regardless\nof whether you\u2019re creating a new app or updating an existing one,\u201d Apple\u2019s instructions say. \n\nApple is not making the use of ATS mandatory for developers right now, but given the way things are\ntrending, that could be coming in the near future. For now, the company is encouraging developers to\nuse ATS in all new and existing apps. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re developing a new app, you should use HTTPS exclusively.

It discovered the behavior during a scan\nfor private API usage, the company said in a blog post published Sunday. \n\nThe problem is twofold: first, users\u2019 privacy is at risk by the apps because device behavior is\nbeing recorded and sent to the developers of a Chinese advertising software development kit called\nYoumi; second, Apple\u2019s rigorous App Store security checks have been bypassed. \n\n\u201cThe danger is in the general technique,\u201d said Nate Lawson, founder of SourceDNA. Lawson said that\nSDK\u2019s behavior is obfuscated, even to the respective apps\u2019 developers, and managing to slip Apple\u2019s\ncode review somehow. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve found code on the App Store that uses private\nAPIs that got past Apple\u2019s code review. There could be other apps out there, we just don\u2019t know yet,\nthat could be using this type of obfuscation to obscure other malicious behavior. It\u2019s troubling\nthis got past Apple\u2019s review process.\u201d \n\nSourceDNA determined that the apps built with the Youmi SDK were able to penetrate an iOS device and\nlist installed apps, retrieve the platform serial number as well as serial numbers for any attached\nperipherals, in addition to getting the user\u2019s Apple ID email address. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pulling much more intrusive information than other advertising SDKs,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cNot only\npersonally identifiable stuff like the email associated with an Apple ID, but device hardware\nidentifiers. Those follow the device even if you reinstall the OS or wipe apps. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why Apple didn\u2019t catch it,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe can surmise it\u2019s because of the\nobfuscation. We can assume Apple catches hundreds of apps all the time; they just don\u2019t make it to\nthe App Store. These did.\u201d \n\nSourceDNA published a statement provided by Apple: \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK, developed by Youmi,\na mobile advertising provider, that uses private APIs to gather private information, such as user\nemail addresses and device identifiers, and route data to its company server. This is a violation of\nour security and privacy guidelines. The apps using Youmi\u2019s SDK will be removed from the App Store\nand any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected. We are working closely\nwith developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in\ncompliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly.\u201d \n\nThe 256 apps, SourceDNA said, have been downloaded more than one million times. The firm said that\n142 older versions of the SDK do not call private APIs, but more recently, the developers have been\nobfuscating a certain call that was not flagged by Apple\u2019s code review. \n\n\u201cOnce they were able to get this through App Review, they probably became more confident they\nweren\u2019t being detected and added the above behaviors in order. They also use the same obfuscation to\nhide calls to retrieve the\u00a0advertising ID, which is allowable for tracking ad clicks, but they may\nbe using it for other purposes since they went to the trouble to obfuscate this,\u201d SourceDNA said.\n\u201cThe latest version of the Youmi SDK (v5.3.0), published a month ago, still gathers all the above\ninformation.\u201d \n\nSince the behavior is obfuscated, app developers that use the Youmi SDK to install ads likely are\nnot aware of the malicious behavior, SourceDNA said. \n\n\u201cMost of the developers are located in China. We believe the developers of these apps aren\u2019t aware\nof this since the SDK is delivered in binary form, obfuscated, and user info is uploaded to Youmi\u2019s\nserver, not the app\u2019s,\u201d SourceDNA said. \u201cWe recommend developers stop using this SDK until this code\nis removed.\u201d \n\nThis is the second disclosure in two weeks regarding the abuse of private APIs in the Apple iOS\necosystem. YiSpecter, which was disclosed Oct. 5 by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, combined the\nuse of certs issued under Apple\u2019s iOS Developer Enterprise Program with the illicit use of private\nAPIs to move adware onto non-jailbroken devices in China and Taiwan primarily. \n\nYiSpecter\u2019s behavior was a bit more malicious. YiSpecter opens a backdoor to a set of command and\ncontrol servers and sends back device data and has the ability to install and launch new Trojanized\napps\u2014some that survive deletion\u2014hijack other apps in order to display ads, change default search\nsetting on Safari, change bookmarks and open webpages in the mobile browser.

It was found in the aftermath of last December\u2019s shooting when Farook and Tashfeen\nMalik gunned down 14 people and wounded 22 others. The FBI, since, has been unable to unlock the\nphone and learn of any other contacts or data pertinent to the investigation. \n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Federal Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ruled that Apple must assist the FBI in cracking\nthe phone by providing a firmware update that would bypass built-in passcode protections that\nintroduce a lag between incorrect guesses and eventually wipe the phone. \n\nPIN guesses must be entered manually, preventing any automated means of guessing via a port on the\ndevice, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The FBI wants the update to disable or bypass the auto-erase capability,\neliminate delays between incorrect guesses and allow for the electronic entry of PINs. \n\n\u201cIn plain English, the FBI wants to ensure that it can make an unlimited number of PIN guesses, that\nit can make them as fast as the hardware will allow, and that they won\u2019t have to pay an intern to\nhunch over the phone and type PIN codes one at a time for the next 20\u00a0years \u2014 they want to guess\npasscodes from an external device like a laptop or other peripheral,\u201d Guido wrote, adding that he\nbelieves this is possible. \n\nThe iPhone 5c is not protected by Apple\u2019s Secure Enclave, which Guido describes as a separate\ncomputer inside iOS that brokers access to encryption keys for services such as file encryption,\nApple Pay, Keychain and more. Secure Enclave was introduced in 2014 with iOS 8, about a year after\nthe 5c was released. \n\n\u201cThink of this like the 2-key system used to launch a nuclear weapon: the passcode alone gets you\nnowhere. Therefore, you must cooperate with the SE to break the encryption,\u201d Guido said. \u201cThe SE\nkeeps its own counter of incorrect passcode attempts and gets slower and slower at responding with\neach failed attempt, all the way up to 1 hour between requests. \n\n\u201cThere is nothing that iOS can do about the SE: it is a separate computer outside of the iOS\noperating system that shares the same hardware enclosure as your phone,\u201d Guido added. \n\nGuido said that with devices equipped with Secure Enclave\u2014any iPhone with TouchID\u2014separate firmware\nupdates for Secure Enclave and iOS would enable a bypass. For the 5c, a single update to iOS would\ndo the trick, Guido said. \n\n\u201cI believe it is technically feasible for Apple to comply with all of the FBI\u2019s requests in this\ncase,\u201d Guido said. \u201cOn the iPhone 5C, the passcode delay and device erasure are implemented in\nsoftware and Apple can add support for peripheral devices that facilitate PIN code entry. In order\nto limit the risk of abuse, Apple can lock the customized version of iOS to only work on the\nspecific recovered iPhone and perform all recovery on their own, without sharing the firmware image\nwith the FBI.\u201d \n\nGuido said that with the bypass, one could fire off one passcode every 80 milliseconds, a big leap\nform one passcode per hour after enough lags. \n\n\u201cAfter the elimination of passcode delays, it will take a half hour to recover a 4-digit PIN, hours\nto recover a 6-digit PIN, or years to recover a 6-character alphanumeric password. It has not been\nreported whether the recovered iPhone uses a 4-digit PIN or a longer, more complicated alphanumeric\npasscode,\u201d Guido said. \n\nSince it\u2019s technically feasible, the tug of war between Cook and the FBI expects to get messy. The\ncourt order mandates only a one-time firmware update for this one device, but as Cooks and privacy\nadvocates at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and elsewhere said, it would set a precedent. \n\n\u201cThe implications of the government\u2019s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs\nAct to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone\u2019s device\nto capture their data,\u201d Cook said in a public letter published yesterday. \u201cThe government could\nextend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your\nmessages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your\nphone\u2019s microphone or camera without your knowledge. \n\n\u201cOpposing this order is not something we take lightly,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe feel we must speak up in the\nface of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.0608240459304289, "subjectivity": 0.4151131374535628, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apples-cook-opposes-court-order-to-hack-san-bernardino-shooters-phone/116274/", "date": "2016-02-17T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple\u2019s Cook Opposes Court Order to Hack San Bernardino Shooter\u2019s Phone", "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook late Tuesday defiantly challenged a U.S federal magistrate judge\u2019s order that it\nhelp the FBI break into an iPhone 5c belonging to one of the shooters involved in last December\u2019s\nattack in San Bernardino, Calif. \n\nCook released a letter last night expressing his opposition to the court order and called for a\npublic discussion about the implications the decision could have on privacy and security moving\nforward. \n\n\u201cThe government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of\u00a0security advancements\nthat protect our customers \u2014 including tens of millions of American citizens \u2014 from sophisticated\nhackers and cybercriminals,\u201d Cook said, later calling the FBI\u2019s actions a dangerous expansion of its\nauthority under the All Writs Act of 1789. \n\nThe court order, granted by Judge Sheri Pym, is a two-page document demanding that Apple assist in\ncracking the phone of suspect Syed Farook. The phone is locked with a four-digit passcode, and with\neach incorrect guess, the lag between the next allowed guess grows, and eventually after 10\nincorrect guesses, the phone will be wiped.

But we can all imagine the\nmyriad ways this new authority could be abused,\u201d Opsahl said. \u201cEven if you trust the U.S.\ngovernment, once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that\nApple undermine the security of their citizens as well.\u201d \n\n\u2018Going Dark\u2019 Ramps Up \n\nThis is the latest chapter in the government\u2019s and law enforcement\u2019s crusade against what it calls\nthe \u201cGoing Dark\u201d problem precipitated by Apple and Google\u2019s decision to relinquish their control\nover the encryption keys protecting iOS and Android devices. As a result, the government can no\nlonger compel the technology giants via court order or National Security Letter to turn over user\ndata from these devices. The keys now live on the devices and are unlocked via the passcode. \n\n\u201cWe can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater\nrisk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against\nweakening encryption,\u201d Cook said. \u201cDoing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding\ncitizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still\nencrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.\u201d \n\nFor months, the government has tried many avenues available to them to circumvent Going Dark, asking\ninitially for backdoors, shared keys and key escrow where multiple parties would share part of the\nkey and use them only under court orders. The complexity introduced by such a plan, experts warned,\nwould be untenable. Not to mention that those same experts warn that exceptional access would also\nbreak forward secrecy and other cryptographic advancements made in the last decade. \n\n\u201cIf we were able to engineer a mechanism where we\u2019re splitting a key and having a third party escrow\nit where the government could ask for it, the very next thing that would happen is that China et al\nwill ask for the same solution. And we\u2019re unlikely to give them the same solution,\u201d said Eric\nWenger, director of cybersecurity and privacy, global government affairs at Cisco Systems.\n\u201cComplexity kills, and the more complex you make a system, the more difficult it is to secure it. I\ndon\u2019t see how developing a key-bases solution secures things the way you want it to without creating\na great deal of complexity and having other governments demand the same thing.\u201d \n\nEarlier this month, a team of crypto luminaries published a paper rebuking the government\u2019s Going\nDark problem, pointing out that while mobile devices do hold a trove of data that is currently out\nof reach, there are many other sources of unencrypted data\u2014metadata and the data produced by sensors\nand other embedded and connected IoT devices are just two examples\u2014that would be of value in\ninvestigations. \n\nRob Graham, a longtime network security expert, wrote yesterday on Errata Security that the age of\nFarook\u2019s device could indeed pave the way to Apple cracking the phone. The 5C, Graham said, isn\u2019t\nprotected by Apple\u2019s Secure Enclave (available since iOS 8), which decrypts authentication inputs\n(passcodes and fingerprints) on the device. \n\n\u201cThe upshot is this. It\u2019s an older phone. If the iOS version is old, and especially if it\u2019s been\nconfigured to \u2018trust\u2019 a laptop/desktop, then there is a good chance Apple or the FBI could decrypt\nit,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf the software is reasonably up-to-date, my understanding of how iPhone\u2019s work,\nit\u2019s impossible at the moment for Apple to decrypt the device, especially as suggested by the court\norder.\u201d \n\nIn the meantime, it would appear Cook and Apple are prepared to bunker in for a long fight. \n\n\u201cWe are challenging the FBI\u2019s demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of\nour country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the\nimplications,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWhile we believe the FBI\u2019s intentions are good, it would be wrong for the\ngovernment to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this\ndemand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.08443139257746, "subjectivity": 0.48719214618091017, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-fixes-cookie-theft-bug-in-ios-9-2-1/115970/", "date": "2016-01-21T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Apple Fixes Cookie Theft Bug in iOS 9.2.1", "body": "When Apple pushed out iOS 9.2.1 earlier this week, it fixed a nasty bug that lingered in the wild\nfor nearly three years and\u00a0could have let an attacker steal cookies and impersonate victims. \n\nThe problem stems from the little windows that pop up when you connect to a public WiFi network\naccording to Skycure, an Israeli mobile security firm that first reported the issue way back in June\n2013. \n\nYair Amit and Adi Sharabani, researchers with Skycure, discovered the issue and discussed it in a\nblog post Wednesday. \n\nThe window that pops up \u2013 the embedded browser that asks users to log in\u00a0via an HTTP interface\u00a0\u2013\ncreates a vulnerability by sharing its cookie store with Safari.

Yet\u00a0another wave of patches arrived Thursday however to address scores\nof vulnerabilities in OS X, iOS, Safari, iTunes, and even the company\u2019s smart watch operating\nsystem, watchOS. \n\nWith the\u00a0iOS update, iOS 9.1, Apple effectively kills two vulnerabilities that a group of Chinese\nhackers, Pangu Team, were using to jailbreak the operating system. The collective had been\nleveraging a heap based buffer overflow and a memory corruption issue to elevate privileges and\nexecute arbitrary code with kernel privileges as part of its jailbreak tool. \n\nThe fixes are part of what\u2019s become a common pattern. Apple fortifies iOS to the best of its\nability, but eventually jailbreakers find a way around Apple\u2019s fixes. \n\n\u201cIt seems that with each new version of iOS, new jailbreaks occur,\u201d Patrick Wardle, the Director of\nResearch at Synack told Threatpost, adding that while jailbreaks may have become more commonplace,\nthe constant back and forth with Apple can be\u00a0still\u00a0risky for jailbreakers. \n\n\u201cTrusting a closed-source jailbreak is always somewhat of a risk \u2013 and also, yes it likely opens up\nthe device up to various iOS malware,\u201d Wardle said, \u201cI think this matters to Apple as they strive\nquite hard to prevent jailbreaks.\u201d \n\nThe iOS update also fixes another issue that Apple\u2019s security team has worked against in the past \u2013\npesky lock screen bugs. This one allowed Phone and Messages notifications to sometimes appear on the\nlock screen when they weren\u2019t supposed to. The iOS 9.1 update also fixes an issue in the online\ncertificate status protocol (OCSP) client that could\u2019ve let an attacker make a revoked certificate\nseem valid. \n\nIn addition to the lock screen bug, the jailbreak bugs, and the certificate bugs, iOS 9.1\nalso\u00a0includes fixes for a dozen other vulnerabilities\u00a0that could have led to code execution, and two\nkernel issues that could have been leveraged to cause a denial of service condition. \n\nIn OS X El Capitan v10.11.1, Apple patched 60 vulnerabilities, including 16 that could have led to\ncode execution, three that could have led to application, or system termination, and\u00a0two that could\nhave led to a denial of service condition. \n\nIn OS X and iOS, Apple addressed a cookie injection attack issue that a group of students brought to\nApple\u2019s attention last month at USENIX. The students stressed that because of a weakness in the way\nApple handled cookies, an attacker could have injected cookies in an HTTP session that could have\nattached themselves to HTTPS connections via a man-in-the-middle attack. \n\nWhile the iOS update was somewhat all encompassing, the Safari update was relatively small potatoes.\nApple fixed several issues in WebKit \u2013 mostly memory corruption bugs \u2013 that could have led to\narbitrary code execution, but that\u2019s it. \n\nLike they did in Safari, Apple also fixed a slew of WebKit issues in iTunes, bringing it to version\n12.3.1. Some could\u2019ve been used to trigger arbitrary code execution or terminated the app through a\nman-in-the-middle attack. \n\nThe operating system that Apple uses for its ever ubiquitous smart watches wasn\u2019t left out of the\nfun either. Apple patched 14 vulnerabilities in watchOS, bringing the operating system to version\n2.0.1. While many of the same bugs fixed in watchOS were also fixed in iOS, the main difference \u2013\naside from a bunch of performance fixes \u2013 is that the watchOS update includes a fix for an Apple Pay\nbug. The vulnerability, CVE-2015-5916, could have let a terminal retrieve limited recent transaction\ninformation from the device when a user was making a payment. Apple fixed that by doing away with\nthe transaction log functionality in Apple Pay entirely. \n\nApple\u00a0last week that patched a handful of issues in the software Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and\niWork.\u00a0Many of the bugs it fixed stemmed from memory corruption vulnerabilities and input validation\nvulnerabilities in the software. \n\n", "polarity": 0.10438707633829584, "subjectivity": 0.3879104635202194, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-patches-100-vulnerabilities-in-os-x-safari-ios/114876/", "date": "2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Apple Patches 100+ Vulnerabilities in OS X, Safari, iOS", "body": "UPDATE Apple pushed out its latest operating system, El Capitan, yesterday, and while it boasts many\nsecurity fixes, the update fails to address the outstanding vulnerability in Gatekeeper that came to\nlight this week. \n\nThe issue with Gatekeeper, as described yesterday by Patrick Wardle, the director of research at\nSynack, fails to verify whether an app runs or loads other apps or dynamic libraries from the same\nor relative directory. Apple is reportedly working on a short term mitigation for the simple, but\neffective bypass that Wardle cooked up and presented at Virus Bulletin today in Prague. \n\nThe new OS X \u00a0doesn\u2019t appear to fix the XARA password stealing vulnerabilities\u00a0in Keychain that a\ncollective of Indiana University students publicized this summer either. When reached by\nThreatpost\u00a0Thursday,\u00a0Luyi Xing, one of the researchers who discovered the flaws in June, claimed\nthat when he checked El Capitan on Wednesday the XARA\u00a0Keychain problem was\u00a0still there and that\u00a0\u201cOS\nX users are still under risks.\u201d \n\nThere is a fix in El Capitan that pertains\u00a0to access control lists as they relate\u00a0to iCloud Keychain\nitems \u2013 and Apple credits Xing and company with discovering the issue \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t fix the XARA\nproblem, which affects the \u201clogin\u201d keychain and\u00a0stemmed from weak and faulty access control lists\nwhich made it easier to gain access to a user\u2019s Keychain items. Apple claims it fixed that issue in\nits Online Store Kit through improved access control list checks. \n\nWhat Apple does fix in El Capitan 10.11 is a slew of other vulnerabilities, 100 in total,\nthat\u00a0existed in everything from Address Book to Mail to Time Machine to Notes. \n\nThe update also fixes roughly 20 bugs in PHP, a trio of bugs in bash, and multiple bugs\u00a0in older\nversions of OpenSSH, and OpenSSL, all of which have been updated to their most recent versions. \n\n45 issues were addressed in Safari 9, which Apple also pushed out Wednesday. In addition to a new\nfeature that can mute audio on some Safari tabs, the latest iteration of the browser also fixed a\nhandful of\u00a0security issues, including bugs that could lead to compromise, arbitrary code execution,\nleak browsing history, and more. The bulk of issues fixed by the update were WebKit-related memory\ncorruption bugs that could have resulted in browser termination, and in one case, thanks to an API,\nleak browsing history, network activity, and mouse movements. \n\nOne of the more curious fixes addressed an issue with how the browser interacted with password\nmanagers. \n\n\u201cThe local communication between Safari extensions such as password managers and their native\ncompanion apps could be comprised by another native app,\u201d Apple warns in its advisory, adding that\nthe issue was addressed by a \u201cnew, authenticated communications channel between Safari extensions\nand companion apps.\u201d \n\nA separate update for iOS brought the mobile operating system to 9.0.2 and fixed another lockscreen\nbypass that was recently identified. Assuming an attacker had access to the physical device, because\nApple enabled its personal assistant Siri on the lockscreen by default, they could access a users\u2019\nphotos and contacts from the lockscreen. \n\nThe bug, dug up by iPhone user Jose Rodriguez, existed in iOS 9, and iOS 9.0.1, but was fixed\nyesterday. \n\nThis article was updated on October 1 to reflect that the XARA vulnerabilities have not been\naddressed in El Capitan \n\n", "polarity": 0.0962689393939394, "subjectivity": 0.40471590909090904, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apples-targeted-gatekeeper-bypass-patch-leaves-os-x-users-exposed/115887/", "date": "2016-01-15T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple\u2019s \u2018Targeted\u2019 Gatekeeper Bypass Patch Leaves OS X Users Exposed", "body": "Apple has had two cracks at patching a vulnerability that allows malicious apps to bypass its OS X\nGatekeeper security feature, and twice has taken a shortcut approach to the fix, said the researcher\nwho reported the flaw. \n\nThe latest measure to address this\u00a0was released on Thursday and it appears Apple again took steps to\nmitigate the immediate problem disclosed privately by Synack director of research Patrick Wardle as\na stopgap measure until a more comprehensive solution can be engineered. \n\nThis saga began last June when Wardle reported a problem in Gatekeeper, a feature added in the\nMountain Lion version of OS X that protects Macs from executing malicious or untrusted apps\ndownloaded from the Internet. Gatekeeper ensures that only apps that are signed with an Apple App\nDeveloper Certificate or downloaded from the Apple App Store are executed. \n\nWardle, just prior to Virus Bulletin in September and again in December, privately disclosed the\nvulnerability (CVE-2015-7024) to Apple. He reported that Gatekeeper checks only the initial\nexecutable that a user double-clicks on at app install. Wardle said that if the initial file then\nexecutes another file in the same directory that Gatekeeper would not verify the second one. \n\n\u201cSo that means I could build an installer package or a zip file and when the user clicks on it, that\nwould actually be the Apple signed binary [that is verified by Gatekeeper],\u201d Wardle said. \u201cThat one\nwould then, behind the scenes, look for a second [malicious] binary which would be in the same\ninstaller package and would execute that.\u201d \n\nApple patched the issue in October, but did so only by blacklisting the binaries that Wardle\nprovided with his proof of concept code. Wardle told Threatpost it took him about 30 seconds to\nbypass the original patch with different binaries, and the same holds true for yesterday\u2019s patch as\nApple took the same approach, except to implement it via XProtect, the antimalware feature built\ninto OS X. \n\n\u201cI believe there are many applications that can be abused to exploit this flaw, so blacklisting is,\nin my opinion, a really bad idea,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s how something is \u2018patched.\u2019 That\ngives users a false sense of security. Also if I\u2019m an (evil) OS X hacker, I\u2019m going to start\nreversing Apple\u2019s patches to figure out the original bugs, and if they mess up the patches or\nprovide a weak ones (as they did in this case), \u2018free\u2019 0days. I think it\u2019d be better for Apple to\nhold off and release a more comprehensive patch that fully addresses the issue.\u201d \n\nWardle is scheduled to speak Sunday at ShmooCon in Washington, D.C., about his Gatekeeper research.\nHe\u2019s also expected to release to open source a kernel extension called Ostiarius that blocks\nunsigned binaries downloaded from the Internet from executing. \n\n\u201cIt gives you a global overview of all process that are being executed. It can check if it\u2019s from\nthe Internet, and if so does it conform to Gatekeeper\u2019s standards, meaning is it signed and\nauthorized,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cThe cool thing about it being in the kernel, the code doesn\u2019t care how\nthat code was executed, whether it was double clicked by the user or by a secondary executable. It\u2019s\na generic point where we can see all processes that are being started. The tool can see new process\nstarted and see whether it\u2019s from the Internet and unsigned, and block it.\u201d \n\nIn the meantime, he said Mac users remain exposed, especially if an attacker already has man-in-the-\nmiddle position on a network, or if they\u2019re downloading apps from an untrusted site; many\norganizations have Apple developer certificates to build enterprise apps for OS X and iOS, and\ndistribute them outside the App Store. Wardle said that apps that are downloaded over insecure HTTP\nconnections are particularly vulnerable to injection attacks if a hacker is already on the network. \n\n\u201cGatekeeper previously would detect and block that,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cNow using this technique,\n[attackers] can bypass Gatekeeper and the user is unaware there is malware on their system, are\ncompletely infected and it\u2019s pretty much game over.\u201d \n\nWardle said that Apple told him that its fix was a \u201cvery targeted patch\u201d and that it was working on\na comprehensive solution. \n\n\u201cThey have some legacy concerns, they don\u2019t want to break existing stuff,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cMy\nreasoning for talking about is that it literally took me five minutes to reverse the patch and find\na new binary. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if hackers and adversaries would do a similar thing,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nnice way to infect Mac users.

While WireLurker was quickly\nsquashed and proved to be fairly benign, its authors demonstrated how the abuse of Apple-issued\nenterprise developer certificates was an effective means of getting malicious code onto non-\njailbroken iPhones and iPads. \n\nAnother threat called YiSpecter has apparently followed WireLurker\u2019s lead and combined the use of\ncerts issued under Apple\u2019s iOS Developer Enterprise Program with the abuse of private APIs to move\nadware onto non-jailbroken iOS devices, primarily in China and Taiwan. \n\nClaud Xiao, a researcher at Palo Alto Networks, yesterday published a report on the malware, which\napparently has been in the wild for 10 months and has poor detection rates on security services such\nas VirusTotal. \n\nSimilarly to WireLurker, YiSpecter opens a backdoor to a set of command and control servers and\nsends back device data and has the ability to install and launch new Trojanized apps\u2014some that\nsurvive deletion\u2014hijack other apps in order to display ads, change default search setting on Safari,\nchange bookmarks and open webpages in the mobile browser. It\u2019s job is largely to spread pornographic\nadware. \n\nUnlike WireLurker, which spread from infected Macbooks to iOS devices, YiSpecter spreads in a\nhandful of ways, benefiting largely from the legitimacy of the certificates, one of which has\nalready been revoked by Apple. \n\n\u201cWe think they\u2019re all legitimate,\u201d said Palo Alto director of researcher Ryan Olson. The\ncertificates cost $299 and are available only to vetted and verified businesses wishing to develop\nenterprise apps for iOS. \u201cThese are intended for internal distribution. Distributing apps in this\nway is not what Apple intended, and why they\u2019re revoking them.\u201d \n\nAcademic research had been done prior to WireLurker that demonstrated the potential for abuse around\nthese certs, and Olson said he expected to see some attacks try to mimic this approach. The\nincreased attention on the issue, in particular on the heels of WireLurker, caused Apple to respond\nin the recently released iOS 9 with a feature that forces users wishing to run a signed app to go\nthrough a couple of extra hoops. The developer, for example, must be trusted in the device settings\nin order to for the signed app to run. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just click \u2018OK.\u2019 You have to dig into the settings if you want to trust the developer.\nThis is the type of feature that prevents this type of attack from being successful,\u201d Olson said.\n\u201cApple has made some good improvements; once iOS 9 rolls out, it will be broadly effective against\nthis.\u201d \n\nThe use of private APIs to install malicious apps is also worrisome in that it can be used to carry\nout a number of sensitive operations, Palo Alto\u2019s Xiao wrote, that are blind to Apple\u2019s enterprise\ndistribution mechanism. YiSpecter is made up of four components, all of which are signed. \n\n\u201cBy abusing private APIs, these components download and install each other from a command and\ncontrol (C2) server,\u201d Xiao wrote. \u201cThree of the malicious components use tricks to hide their icons\nfrom iOS\u2019s SpringBoard, which prevents the user from finding and deleting them. The components also\nuse the same name and logos of system apps to trick iOS power users.\u201d \n\nYiSpecter is not an App Store threat. It moves over a number of distinct channels posing as an\nalternative to the popular QVOD media player used to exchange and view pornography in China. Once\nQVOD was shut down by law enforcement in April, the attackers behind YiSpecter targeted those users\nwith the malware. \n\nYiSpecter\u2019s most interesting propagation method is its abuse of a practice carried out by local ISPs\nwho inject JavaScript and HTML advertising into traffic.

The ACLU reports the All Writs Act has been\nwidely used since 2008 in cases primarily related to investigation of drug crimes. \n\nThe interactive map shows 63 confirmed cases. However, the ACLU says it\u2019s aware of 13 more cases\n(included on the map) along with one case in Massachusetts and 12 pending cases identified by Apple\n(not reflected on the map). \n\nThe pivotal issue for legal scholars isn\u2019t that the courts are demanding help from Apple and Google\nto crack open phones. Legal experts says it\u2019s the fact that laws written in 1789 are being bent and\nused to force tech companies to comply. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to our legal system that the All Writs Act can still be flexible enough to be\nrelevant today,\u201d said Ed McAndrew, a cyber security attorney with the law firm Ballard Spahr and\nformer federal cybercrime prosecutor. \u201cHow relevant the All Writs Act is, we still don\u2019t know,\u201d he\nadded. \n\nMcAndrew said that while the FBI\u2019s legal battle with Apple may be over, it won\u2019t be long before a\nsimilar case rises to the same level of precedent. \u201cThis is very much a live issue that is not going\naway just because the DOJ has dropped its request demanding Apple\u2019s help,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cAs each of the cases highlighted on this map indicate, the questions our legal system is struggling\nto answer are; what is the impact of encryption on law enforcement\u2019s ability to investigate and\nmitigate crimes? Second, what does digital privacy and security mean and can things ever be too\nsecure?\u201d McAndrew said. McAndrew says that there are likely dozens more cases involving the All\nWrits Act scattered around the country and that the courts need consensus on how the All Writs Act\ncan be used in each of those cases. \n\nOne of the more interesting ACLU revelations was the fact Google has also faced multiple requests by\nfederal agents to assist with opening Android devices. In those cases (in Alabama, New Mexico, North\nCarolina, North Dakota, Oregon and South Dakota) the government also use the All Writs Act to help\ngovernment investigators pry open phones. \n\nIn one drug related case that dates back to 2015, Google received a court order to help retrieve\ndata off of two Android phones (Alcatel and Kyocera). \u201cThe Application seeks an order requiring\nGoogle to use any such capabilities, so as to assist agents in complying with the search warrant,\u201d\nread the court order. The court demanded Google provide a \u201csingle password reset\u201d, hand over the new\npassword and also reset the Google account password. \n\nThe ACLU\u2019s public disclosure of past cases comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s clash with the Justice\nDepartment that centered around access to San Bernardino shooter Farook\u2019s iPhone. That battle came\nto an end Monday when the FBI said it was able to hack into the phone and no longer needed Apple\u2019s\nassistance. \n\nEver since the FBI insisted its order for Apple to help it crack into the terrorist\u2019s cellphone was\na one-time request, a chorus of skeptical privacy and security experts have questioned the\ngovernment\u2019s intent. \n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, in an open letter to Apple customers on Feb. 16 wrote: \u201cThe government suggests\nthis tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true.\u201d \n\nCook wrote that the Justice Department\u2019s use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify forcing Apple\nto remove security features and features to the iPhone went too far. \u201cThe implications of the\ngovernment\u2019s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to\nunlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone\u2019s device to capture their data,\u201d he\nwrote. \n\n", "polarity": 0.09216004583651645, "subjectivity": 0.44792568542568534, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-deprecates-quick-time-for-windows-wont-patch-new-flaws/117427/", "date": "2016-04-14T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple Deprecates QuickTime For Windows, Won\u2019t Patch New Flaws", "body": "The Zero Day Initiative has publicly disclosed a pair of serious vulnerabilities in Apple QuickTime\nfor Windows that will not be patched because Apple is deprecating the product for the Microsoft\nplatform. \n\nUS-CERT today pushed out an alert advising QuickTime for Windows users that the only mitigation is\nto uninstall the software. \n\n\u201cComputers running QuickTime for Windows will continue to work after support ends.

Developers have never been given access to a decrypted version of the iOS kernel. The\niOS kernel is the heart of the iPhone and iPad and grants third-party apps access to, and limits use\nof, Apple hardware assets. \n\nBy delivering an unencrypted version of the beta iOS 10 kernel, some argue, Apple is opening its\ncherished OS to both the good guys and black hat hackers. \n\nSome say\u00a0the lack of encryption opens up iOS to outside scrutiny by bad guys who until now could\nonly dream of reverse engineering the kernel to write malicious code against it. \n\n\u201c(Encrypting the kernel) is not just about keeping the kernel secret but more importantly, it\u2019s\nabout keeping the kernel from being changed. Any hack or subversion on the kernel would be\nimmediately apparent so this is very powerful. Imagine if the key used to encrypt and sign the\nkernel was misused\u2026that\u2019s what I call a real cyber weapon,\u201d said Kevin Bocek, VP of security\nstrategy and threat intelligence at Venafi. \n\nBocek and others point out, just because the kernel doesn\u2019t contain any user info doesn\u2019t mean the\nunencrypted code couldn\u2019t be used to hack the kernel as part of a way to carry out key OS security\nbreaches. \n\n\u201cNow that it is public, people will be able to study it [and] potentially find ways around it,\u201d said\nMathew Solnik, a\u00a0Senior Security Researcher with Azimuth Security,\u00a0when speaking with MIT Tech\nReview\u00a0earlier this month. \n\nThe flip side of argument is that Apple now has more white-hat hacker eyeballs poring over its iOS\ncode helping identify vulnerabilities. That serves the dual purpose of hardening the iOS defenses\nwith more vulnerability feedback and takes the wind out of the sails of the grey-market for iOS\nexploits. \n\n\u201cOf course, this unencrypted kernel is also a good thing since it allows for the identification of\nmore vulnerabilities and bugs in the open, instead of a government finding and hoarding them (as is\nthe case with FBI that won\u2019t tell Apple and the world about the vulnerability exploited in the San\nBernardino case),\u201d Bocek said. \n\nHe argues, by decrypting the kernel, Apple is throwing the FBI and law enforcement outside the U.S.\na bone. \u201cThis is of course what the FBI wanted from Apple and what UK and France law enforcement\nteams can show up and demand,\u201d Bocek said. \n\nObviously, at the same time Apple is generating unobscured iOS 10 beta kernel cache data it\u2019s\nhardening its encryption of its default messaging app iMessage including. Apple states\nunequivocally: \u201cWe also refuse to add a \u2018backdoor\u2019 into any of our products because that undermines\nthe protections we\u2019ve built in.

They also used the hearing to clarify stances on\nencryption and set the record straight on the FBI\u2019s use of \u201cgrey hat\u201d hackers and Apple\u2019s ties to\nChina. \n\nDuring the hearing, Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell made it clear Apple refused a request by\nChina to to hand over its source code for its iPhone. Sewell was responding to allegations earlier\nin the hearings suggesting that Apple was more interested a cozy business relationship with China\nversus cooperating with the U.S. law enforcement in criminal investigations. \n\n\u201cI want to be very clear on this.

She said that working with for-profit hackers wasn\u2019t an ideal situation, but the FBI\nlacked the capability to crack open the iPhone itself. \n\nThe Apple and FBI meeting comes after a standoff where a federal judge ordered Apple to provide\n\u201creasonable technical assistance\u201d to help the FBI access Farook\u2019s iPhone by bypassing a program that\nerases the phone\u2019s data if too many incorrect passwords are entered.

But, by the end of the hearing\nit was apparent the House Energy and Commerce Committee wasn\u2019t any closer to \u00a0answering the question\nof whether the government should have the ability to lawfully access encrypted technology and\ncommunications. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been five-and-half years and I\u2019ve been hearing everyone talk about encryption and not getting\nanything done.

The trio were in the midst of research on URI\nhandler bugs when Shah inadvertently opened iMessage instead of another messaging app he was\nexamining. Given that the app was open, he tried the proof-of-concept they had in hand and it\nworked. DeMesy and Shah said they believe the flaw and exploit could work on messaging apps for\nother platforms, but aren\u2019t close to disclosing yet. \n\nThey did privately report this bug to Apple, which patched it in short order, the researchers said. \n\n \n\nThe vulnerability affects only iMessage on OS X, but since many attach an iCloud account to Macbooks\nand sync their iPhones to iMessage, Shah said it is possible that any messages linked to the account\ncould be stolen via their exploit. \n\n\u201cThe end game is to steal the iMessage database, and if you have your [iPhone] synched to the\niMessage app, all messages on the phone are also synched to the same database,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIn that\nscenario, if you receive a link from any user and click, not only your messages on your computer,\nbut also on your phone will be sent to the attacker.\u201d \n\nThe researchers\u2019 proof-of-concept exploit allows for any code to be sent to the client, but only\nJavaScript would execute thanks to the vulnerability. All other code would be confined to the Apple\nOS X sandbox, denying the attacker access to arbitrary files, for example. \n\nThe researchers published a report that explains the vulnerability lies in the app\u2019s implementation\nof Webkit, and a design capability where it can execute JavaScript and other scripts related to the\nweb, the researchers said. \n\n\u201cThe iMessage app would convert links on a loose type of restriction,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIf it thought it\nlooked like a link, it would convert it to a hyperlink in the viewer. Because of the flaw, we could\ninsert JavaScript via a neat little trick. Using javascript://, which is supposed to be a comment,\nwe insert a URI instead and iMessage converts it to an actual link.\u201d \n\nThis is a default Webkit feature, DeMesy said, and dates back 20 years and said that a lot of Web\napps rely on this type of functionality. Apple\u2019s update removed the ability to render JavaScript\nlinks as clickable, remediating the issue, the researchers said. \n\n\u201cYou would never be able to do that in Chrome,\u201d DeMesy said. \u201cA lot of apps rely on that\nfunctionality, but in this case, we know it can only be used to render in iMessage, so it can be\nsafely disabled [without breaking other functionality].\u201d \n\nShah said their proof of concept requires only a basic knowledge of JavaScript and a payload of only\n50 lines of JavaScript, something he said could be shrunken down. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at memory corruption or buffer overflow bugs, since you\u2019re literally crashing the\nsystems to get the exploit to work, there\u2019s always a reliability problem with those bugs,\u201d DeMesy\nsaid. \u201cThis is 100 percent reliable. It\u2019s definitely a new class of exploit too.

But that wasn\u2019t the case today during\nthe annual Cryptographers\u2019 Panel at RSA Conference. \n\nThe debate over whether Apple should assist the FBI in unlocking an accused terrorist\u2019s iPhone has\nmoved through separate and disparate court rulings and has been headline news in the mainstream\nmedia. While the two sides are pretty defined\u2014Apple on the side of privacy and against the legal\nprecedent its assistance would set, and the FBI on the side of national security and the emotional\narguments that accompany it\u2014the opinions of the panel were not in lockstep. \n\nAdi Shamir, a crypto pioneer and co-developer of the RSA algorithm, stood with the FBI and argued\nthat Apple had misstepped in not anticipating all possible ways law enforcement could request data.\nHe also reasoned that this is a one-time request for one device and that the government\u2019s request is\nnot unreasonable. \n\n\u201cHere, the FBI had been waiting for a long time for the ideal situation and they found it,\u201d Shamir,\na resident of Israel said. \u201cThis is a case where it\u2019s clear those people are guilty. They are dead;\ntheir constitutional rights are not involved. This is a major crime where 14 people were killed. The\nphone is intact. All of this aligns in favor of the FBI. Even though Apple has helped in countless\ncases, they decided not to comply this time. My advice is that they comply this time and wait for a\nbetter test case to fight where the case is not so clearly in favor of the FBI.\u201d \n\nRon Rivest, Shamir\u2019s colleague on the RSA algorithm along with Len Adelman, quickly disagreed with\nShamir and said the precedent set if Apple is legally compelled to help the FBI would be\n\u201cbreathtaking in scope.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat the FBI is asking is not just for this one phone, but it\u2019s asking a third party to do\nsomething they don\u2019t normally do,\u201d Rivest said. \u201cIt seems inappropriate. This debate belongs in\nCongress. They should make a law that guides us in the future with better balances.\u201d \n\nApple did earn a legal victory yesterday when a New York judge ruled against the FBI and said the\ngovernment\u2019s stance using the All Writs Act to back up its claims against Apple cannot be used.\nBrooklyn federal magistrate James Orenstein said the FBI\u2019s expansive interpretation of the All Writs\nAct would not withstand constitutional scrutiny. \n\nMoxie Marlinspike, a first-time panelist, said that Apple\u2019s decision to relinquish control of its\ndevices\u2019 crypto keys served to make its customers\u2019 products safer\u2014an unusual move among tech\nproviders, he said. He added that defiance in the face of the law has helped to overturn many\nstatutes deemed unreasonable, pointing toward gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana as two\nexamples. \n\n\u201cI might have an unpopular opinion, but chances are there\u2019s nothing on this device,\u201d Marlinspike\nsaid. The phone was issued to San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook by his employer San Bernardino\nCounty; Farook had already destroyed two personal iPhones, and this one was found left in a drawer\nby the FBI. \n\n\u201cThis was not his private device. The FBI already has the server-side logs and [an older] iCloud\nbackup. They have a tremendous amount of information. They\u2019ve said they need this information\nbecause they might be missing something. I\u2019m of the opinion that law enforcement should be hard. \u2026\nThe FBI is saying they consider their surveillance capabilities as something that is for our social\ngood. I don\u2019t necessarily think that is good.\u201d \n\nRivest, along with fellow remaining panelists and this year\u2019s Turing Award winners Whitfield Diffie\nand Martin Hellman, sided with Apple. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re opening a can of worms here that is the wrong way to go,\u201d Rivest said. \u201cThe road to hell\nstarts with a backdoor. These systems we have are so fragile, that trying to have extra keys,\nduplicate keys or new ways of taking things apart isasking all kinds trouble.

For cryptographer and professor Matthew Green\nand a team of four Johns Hopkins University graduate students, it was a road map to understanding\nnot only how secure Apple\u2019s iMessage messaging application was, but also one that helped them\nuncover a handful of significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited to put the contents of\nencrypted messages at risk to advanced attackers. \n\nThe vulnerabilities were\u00a0patched today with the release of iOS 9.3 and an updated version of OS X.\nOf perhaps larger importance is the context they bring to the ongoing Apple-FBI legal fight over\nencryption. The team of Green and students Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Gabriel Kaptchuk and Michael\nRushanan demonstrated how a resourced attacker could pick apart flaws in what is widely considered\nthe most secure, commercial messaging platform to get at messages sent to a target phone. They\ncontend that the FBI\u2019s court order for the introduction of intentionally weak crypto, or other\nproposals such as key escrow, aren\u2019t necessary when security issues like these can be ferreted out. \n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t get you access to data on the phone.

How much worse would you make it by weakening things? You\ncan\u2019t take for granted that crypto works all the time and plan policy things above it.\u201d \n\nThe flaws found by the Johns Hopkins researchers date back to iMessage\u2019s inception, Miers said. The\nteam found a weak spot in the encryption protocol that iMessage uses in all of its applications, one\nthat Green spotted in the iOS Security Guide. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a diagram describing the way the encryption is structured; there\u2019s a subtle oversight in\nthe way it\u2019s done,\u201d Miers said. Rather than authenticate the encrypted portion of an iMessage, Apple\nopted to sign each with an ECDSA signature. Those signatures can be attacked, the researchers said,\nputting not only messages in transit at risk, but also those stored on Apple servers, which Apple\nstores for up to 30 days. \n\nThe vulnerabilities were privately disclosed in November and were addressed in today\u2019s iOS and OS X\n(10.11.4) updates in a number of different ways, including the enforcement of certificate pinning\nacross all channels used by iMessage, and the removal of compression used for attachments from\niMessage composition. \n\nFrom the Johns Hopkins paper: \n\n\u201cOur results show that an attacker who obtains iMessage ciphertexts can, at least for some types of\nmessages, retrospectively decrypt traffic. Because Apple stores encrypted, undelivered messages on\nits servers and retains them for up to 30 days, such messages are vulnerable to any party who can\nobtain access to this infrastructure, e.g., via court order, or by compromising Apple\u2019s globally\ndistributed server infrastructure. Similarly, an attacker who can intercept TLS using a stolen\ncertificate may be able to intercept iMessages on certain versions of iOS and Mac OS/X that do not\nemploy certificate pinning on Apple Push Network Services (APNs) connections. \n\nMiers explained that the team\u2019s proof-of-concept attack against the latest versions of iMessage or\nOS X required an attacker be on Apple\u2019s system or be in a man-in-the-middle position against TLS\ntraffic in order to obtain iOS ciphertext sent or received by a client. Their attack, while silent,\nrequired them to slightly edit an\u00a0intercepted iMessage up to 130,000 times in order to study subtle\nchanges in the response and to learn more about the encryption key. The attack took 72 hours\u2014it\ncould likely be optimized and the time lowered\u2014and once they were successful, they were able to use\nthe key to decrypt the photo or video attachment to the iMessage communication. \n\n\u201cThe hardest part is getting your hands on the message to start with,\u201d Miers said. \u201cIt requires you\nto have the ability to coerce, hack or subpoena Apple, or break TLS.\u201d For older versions of\niMessage, an attacker could steal or forge a certificate from Apple in order to break TLS. The\nresearchers built a customized version of pushproxy for their PoC that mimicked an Apple server. The\nproxy allows them to carry out local attacks against devices on the same network, but if an attacker\ncould pull off the same attack against Apple\u2019s infrastructure, the attacks could be done remotely,\nthe researchers said in their paper. The team said that in most cases they were able to get up to\n224 bits of the key via their attack, and used a brute-force attack to get the remainder of the\nsecret key using commodity hardware. \n\n\u201cThe main point is that the sky is not falling with this,\u201d Miers said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that\ncrypto is not easy to get right, and that adding backdoors and complexity would only cause more\nproblems.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.047738095238095225, "subjectivity": 0.5361734693877552, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/fbi-drops-its-case-against-apple/116918/", "date": "2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "FBI Vacates Today\u2019s Apple Hearing", "body": "Update\u00a0The FBI has dropped its case\u00a0filed a motion to vacate today\u2019s scheduled court hearing and\nshowdown over its demands that Apple help unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone. \n\nThe government late Monday afternoon filed a motion to vacate its case, likely putting a halt to a\nsaga that began in mid-February when a federal magistrate ordered Apple to help the FBI access a\nphone belonging to one of the shooters involved in last December\u2019s attack that killed 14 in San\nBernardino, Calif. \n\nThe motion also indicates that the FBI may have found a way onto the phone without Apple\u2019s help. \n\n\u201cOn Sunday, March 20, 2016, an outside party demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking\n[shooter Syed] Farook\u2019s iPhone,\u201d the motion says. \u201cTesting is required to determine whether it is a\nviable method that will not compromise data on Farook\u2019s iPhone. If the method is viable, it should\neliminate the need for the assistance from Apple Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) set forth in the All Writs Act Order\nin this case.\u201d \n\nSecurity and privacy experts stood alongside Apple, which from Day 1 contested the court order on\nthe grounds that it would set a dangerous precedent by weakening the encryption protecting its\ndevices and allow the government and law enforcement to use the 200-plus-year-old All Writs Act as a\nlaunchpad to access data stored on other devices in the future. \n\n\u201cThis was the FBI\u2019s hand-chosen case to set a legal precedent and allow them to order companies to\nbreak the security on phones,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier\nFoundation. \u201cThis case was never about one phone. It was always about the legal precedent. I think\nthe government was wildly surprised by the level of opposition to its case and the level of support\nApple got. The government was frankly taken by surprise by that. And they blinked.\u201d \n\nThe government said in its motion that it will file a status report with the courts by April 5. \n\nIn the meantime, this is a landmark win on many fronts, starting with those who advocate for privacy\nand against surveillance, and for technology companies, many of which sided with Apple and surely\nhad some anxiety about the possible outcome of tomorrow\u2019s scheduled hearing. \n\n\u201cWe live in a golden age of surveillance,\u201d Cardozo said. Everything that we do online is available\nto law enforcement all of the time. Encryption is going to give people back their privacy in small\namounts, some of the time. [Law enforcement] doesn\u2019t like that. Encryptiom makes things difficult\nfor them.\u201d \n\nIndeed, law enforcement and government officials, starting with FBI director James Comey have made\ntheir case for exceptional access since the day Apple relinquished control over encryption keys to\nthe user and the device. No longer could the FBI compel Apple to hand over user data via a warrant.\nThe Apple case, experts said, was the FBI\u2019s way to regain some of that reach by using the courts to\ncompel Apple to build new firmware that would allow the FBI to conduct an offline brute-force attack\nagainst Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c in order to guess the passcode without wiping the device. Current\nprotections on the iPhone introduce a time lag between incorrect guesses, and on the 10th miss, all\ndata on the device is wiped. \n\n\u201cI think the government is wildly out of touch with the technological community,\u201d Cardozo said. \u201cThe\ngovernment just played this as it being about one phone. Everyone knew that was a bold-faced lie\nfrom Day 1. The government honestly believes that if the nerds try hard enough, they will be able to\ncreate a magic golden key. It doesn\u2019t matter how often the security experts, computer scientists and\nmathmeticians tell them it\u2019s not possible.

So far,\u00a0AceDeceiver has\u00a0only impacted\u00a0iOS\nusers in China, and it is unique because it is the first known successful malware infection of non-\njailbroken devices using Apple\u2019s FairPlay digital rights management system, researchers said. \n\n\u201cFirst it was XcodeGhost, then ZergHelper and now AceDeceiver. What we are seeing is a slow chipping\naway at Apple\u2019s App Store security,\u201d said\u00a0Ryan Olson, director of threat intelligence for Palo Alto\nNetworks, in an interview with Threatpost. AceDeceiver, he said, gives man-in-the-middle attackers\naccess to iOS devices along with ability trick users out of their Apple IDs. \n\nOlson said the AceDeceiver Trojan is also unique because it differs from previous iOS malware that\nabused legitimate\u00a0Apple developer\u00a0certificates to attack non-jailbroken Apple devices such as\nZergHelper. This exploit does not. Instead, attackers are using a variation of the 2-year-old\ntechnique known as a \u201cFairPlay Man-In-The-Middle\u201d attack. According to Palo Alto\u2019s report on the\nAceDeceiver, this iteration is the first used to install malicious apps on iOS devices without a\nuser\u2019s knowledge. \n\nThose behind AceDeceiver are currently only targeting users in China, Palo Alto reports. But Olson\npoints out, other geographic regions could be easily targeted as well. \n\nAccording to researchers, attackers laid the groundwork for AceDeceiver months in advance. Between\nJuly 2015 and January 2016, Palo Alto said, attackers submitted three different flavors of\nAceDeceiver\u2019s screen saver software to Apple\u2019s App Store. \n\nPalo Alto said the three apps were designed to trick Apple into supplying attackers with iTunes app\nauthorization code that would later be used in tandem with a Windows application called Aisi Helper.\nMarketed exclusively to PC users based in China, Aisi Helper promotes itself as a utility for iOS\nusers interested in iOS system backups and re-installation, jailbreaking, device management and\nsystem cleaning, Palo Alto said. \n\nBut when Windows users installed the Aisi Helper software on their PC and connected their iOS device\nto the same computer, attackers could surreptitiously install rogue apps onto iOS devices without\nthe users\u2019 consent. Attackers accomplished this by spoofing Apple\u2019s FairPlay DRM handshake using\ntheir own AceDeceiver authorization server. This type of attack is called a \u201cFairPlay Man-In-The-\nMiddle\u201d attack which was first uncovered in 2014. \n\nWhen alerted to the AceDeceiver vulnerability in February, Apple removed the three apps. But, Palo\nAlto said the vulnerability was still exploitable via the Aisi Helper software. \u201cAs long as an\nattacker could get a copy of authorization from Apple, the attack doesn\u2019t require current App Store\navailability to spread those apps,\u201d researchers wrote. Olson said the flaw in Apple\u2019s DRM boils down\nto the fact its authorization can be used outside of the iTunes ecosystem. \n\nOnce installed on the users iOS device, the AceDeceiver apps can function as a third-party app store\non users devices, according to researchers. The third-party app store is controlled by attackers and\noffers a variety of utilities and games. Users are also prompted to input their Apple IDs and\npasswords for unfettered access to free pirated iOS apps. \n\nIn February, Palo Alto researchers discovered a similar China-specific third-party app store that\nmanaged to slip past Apple App Store code reviewers. However, that incident involved an app named\nZergHelper or XY Helper that abused a combination of Apple\u2019s enterprise certificates and its Xcode 7\ndeveloper certificates. \n\nIn the case of ZergHelper, Apple was able snuff out the security hole by removing the app from its\nstore. However, Olson said Apple will have a much more difficult time neutralizing the AceDeceiver\nTrojan because it relies on a Windows client software and uses once valid app authentication in\ntandem with FairPlay DRM design flaws. \n\nApple did not return Threatpost\u2019s request for comment for this article. \n\n", "polarity": 0.10479096520763188, "subjectivity": 0.5042157687991023, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-counters-fbis-backdoor-demand-as-unconstitutional/116822/", "date": "2016-03-16T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Apple Counters FBI\u2019s Backdoor Demand as Unconstitutional", "body": "Apple has matched the Department of Justice\u2019s recent vitriol, by this week calling the FBI\u2019s request\nfor code to help it unlock Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone unconstitutional. \n\nFurthermore, Apple in a court filing this week again challenged the validity of the government\u2019s use\nof the All Writs Act of 1789 as justification in compelling Apple to build new firmware that will\nbypass existing security on the device. \n\n\u201cThe government attempts to rewrite history by portraying the Act as an all-powerful magic wand\nrather than the limited procedural tool it is,\u201d Apple\u2019s attorneys wrote in a brief filed with a\nCalifornia District Court. \n\nApple argues in the brief that the All Writs Act has no authority to gain relief in situations\nwhere: \u201cCongress enacts a specific statute prohibiting the precise action (i.e., says a court may\nnot \u2018order a smartphone manufacturer to remove barriers to accessing stored data on a particular\nsmartphone,\u2019), or where the government seeks to \u2018arbitrarily dragoon\u2019 or \u2018forcibly deputize\u2019 \u2018random\ncitizens\u2019 off the street. \n\n\u201cThus, according to the government, short of kidnapping or breaking an express law, the courts can\norder private parties to do virtually anything the Justice Department and FBI can dream up. The\nFounders would be appalled,\u201d Apple wrote. \n\nApple stands by a legal declaration that computer code is the equivalent of speech, and is therefore\nprotected under the First Amendment. \n\nLast week, the Department of Justice countered a previous request by Apple that the courts vacate\nthe order to comply with harsh language challenging Apple\u2019s motives as marketing and brand driven,\nand calling its rhetoric \u201ccorrosive.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe government seeks to commandeer Apple to design, create, test, and validate a new operating\nsystem that does not exist, and that Apple believes\u2014with overwhelming support from the technology\ncommunity and security experts\u2014is too dangerous to create,\u201d Apple\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cSeeking to\nbelittle this widely accepted policy position, the government grossly mischaracterizes Apple\u2019s\nobjection to the requested Order as a concern that \u2018compliance will tarnish its brand'\u201d \n\nApple has been asked to build new iOS firmware that would disable or bypass security provisions in\nthe operating system that prevent brute-force attacks against the passcode unlocking the phone; the\nphone automatically wipes itself after 10 missed guesses.

Compelling Apple to create forensic software for the government is also dangerous\ndue to any bugs the software might contain.\u201d \n\nThe brief also notes that nothing in the All Writs Act or the court order would make similar updates\nto smart TVs or laptop cameras off limits, and that bypasses in those realms pose worse security and\nprivacy repercussions, and could put personal safety at risk. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, the experts warn that should the order be upheld, it would undermine\nthe trust and reliability consumers have in automatic software update mechanisms. \n\n\u201cThe belief that such an update could be spyware that a company was forced by the government to sign\nand distribute might lead people to turn off automatic updates,\u201d the brief says. \u201cThis would render\nsoftware patches less effective and the general public less secure.\u201d \n\nThe FBI request essentially boils down to it having the ability to have a computer guess the phone\u2019s\npasscode. Currently, security on the device requires manually entered guesses and inserts an\nescalating time lag between incorrect guesses before eventually wiping the phone after 10 failed\ntries. The court order asked Apple to build new firmware that would disable those protections, and\ninsists this is a one-time request. \n\nThe brief concedes that while Apple has complied with some data extraction requests in the past, it\ndid so on older phones running iOS 8.0 or older. On these devices, it was able to extract data\nbecause it was not encrypted using a key generated from the user\u2019s passcode as is the case with\nnewer phones. \n\nAlso worrisome from the experts\u2019 point of view is that the requisite firmware update would have to\nbe cryptographically signed by Apple. This mechanism, the brief says, is an implied assurance to\ncustomers that Apple will not manipulate their devices and that the software is safe to run and\ncannot be turned into a FBI surveillance device. \n\n\u201cThe Order would compel Apple to create new software that does not currently exist, to carry out a\ncapability Apple does not presently have,\u201d the brief says. \u201cThis is the first time any Court has\never publicly ordered a vendor to do something like this.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.020996914962432202, "subjectivity": 0.37089739762153545, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/putting-apple-bug-bounty-rewards-in-perspective/119794/", "date": "2016-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Putting Apple Bug Bounty Rewards in Perspective", "body": "Admittedly, the payouts for Apple\u2019s bug bounty announced last week at Black Hat drew mixed reactions\nranging from reasonable to raucously funny. \n\nApple made a big splash at the annual hacker conference, first via a last-minute announcement that\nwell-regarded Ivan Krstic would be giving a talk on some of the inner workings of iOS 10 security\nfeatures, and then during Krstic\u2019s talk, the curtain was pulled back on the bounty program. \n\nApple is offering researchers a maximum payout of $200,000 for SecureBoot firmware compromises. Five\nareas of iOS are in scope for payouts ranging at the low end of $25,000 for sandbox escapes, upwards\nto $50,000 for bugs allowing access to iCloud accounts on Apple\u2019s servers and code execution bugs at\nthe kernel level, to $100,000 for exploits against the Secure Enclave Processor. \n\n \n\nGiven that it\u2019s well known the black market has paid seven figures in the past for iOS bugs and last\nyear, zero-day buyers Zerodium offered a $1 million iOS bounty, Apple\u2019s payouts do pale a tad\ndespite being among the highest corporate bug bounty payouts on record. \n\nThen yesterday, Exodus Intelligence announced its Research Sponsorship Program, an acquisition\nprogram focusing on zero-day and N-day vulnerabilities and exploits that further dampened the hype\naround Apple\u2019s new program. Exodus\u2019 so-called zero-day Hitlist, or payment structure, severely\nundercuts Apple\u2019s bounty program by offering a $500,000 maximum for iOS 9.3+ bugs. \n\nExodus is also offering six figures for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge zero days ($150,000 and\n$125,000 respectively), $80,000 for Firefox, $75,000 for Windows 10 local privilege escalation zero-\ndays, and $60,000 each for 0day in Adobe Flash and Reader. \n\nExodus also described a unique payment system that includes bonuses paid out until the zero day is\npatched. \n\n\u201cFor each new Zero-Day acquired,\u00a0Exodus\u00a0will offer the researcher an initial payment, received after\nthe request is reviewed and accepted. Once accepted, the researcher could receive payments every\nquarter the Zero-Day exploit is still alive. The specific values of the initial payment and\nquarterly bonus will be included in an offer presented to the researcher, following the review of\ntheir work. Additionally,\u00a0Exodus\u00a0also offers payment in the form of Bitcoin for Zero-Day research.\u201d \n\nApple\u2019s bug bounty was received with applause at Black Hat and Apple was generally considered the\nlast holdout among major technology vendors to reward researchers for disclosing security flaws. \n\n\u201cThis is somewhat of a no-brainer for Apple\u2014in terms of increasing the security of their devices and\nOSes,\u201d said Synack director of research Patrick Wardle, a longtime Mac OS X bug hunter who has\ndisclosed numerous issue to Apple. \u201cApple has a solid security team comprised of intelligent\nindividuals. However, it\u2019s unlikely that any company\u2019s security team can provide the same coverage\nas a well-managed bug-bounty program. Generally speaking, having more \u2018eyes\u2019 looking for bugs is a\ngood thing.\u201d \n\nApple has limited its bounty program to a couple dozen researchers, Krstic said at Black Hat.\nDespite the program being invitation-only at first, Krstic said that researchers who submit bugs in\nany of the classes in scope could also be considered. \n\n\u201cThe scope is pretty tight, only extending to iOS and iCloud vulnerabilities. It would make sense\nfor Apple to extend it to other properties \u2014 they likely will eventually, assuming the current\nprogram is successful,\u201d said researcher Randy Westergren Jr., who has privately disclosed security\nissues to Adobe, Verizon, United Airlines and Marriott hotels among others. \u201cI think Apple joining\nthe bug bounty club was inevitable, especially since most of its serious competitors have been\noperating theirs for some time. It continues to send the right message to other top tier\norganizations that are holding out: bug bounties are a step in the right direction.\u201d \n\nApple would not say what the tipping point was for it to move forward with a bug bounty. But iOS in\nparticular has been in the headlines for months starting with the FBI\u2019s very public fight against\nApple for help in unlocking the San Bernardino terrorist\u2019s iPhone earlier this year. Needless to\nsay, iOS bugs are at the top of most hitlists beyond Exodus Intelligence\u2019s. \n\n\u201cAs Apple often does, it approaches things in a calculated, somewhat cautious manner. Due to recent\nevents (FBI vs. Apple), iOS is somewhat on the forefront of security \u2013 both in the press and on\npeople\u2019s minds,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cAlso, there are companies who are willing to pay a ton of money for\niOS bugs. Both these things, make it quite reasonable for Apple to begin their bug bounty program\nwith iOS and iCloud.\u201d \n\nThe priorities of the rewards show that Apple doesn't care too much about the bugs real attackers\ncare about most. https://t.co/KpdVZN7aOJ \n\n\u2014 the grugq (@thegrugq) August 5, 2016 \n\n \n\n99.9% of \"researchers\" after reading the headlines about Apple's bug bounty: \n\n\"Yesssssssssssss\" \n\nAfter reading the details: \n\n\"Oh\u2026\" \n\n\u2014 Andreas Lindh (@addelindh) August 5, 2016 \n\n \n\nWhy is it that Apple can drop billions on marginally useful companies, but can\u2019t throw a few million\nat a bug bounty to secure iOS / OS X? \n\n\u2014 Jonathan Zdziarski (@JZdziarski) June 30, 2016 \n\n \n\nWhile some were dismayed by the payouts announced, others such as Westergren and Wardle said the\npayouts were fair and reasonable. \n\n\u201cThere will always be researchers that complain about payouts, but we\u2019ve come a long way from the\ndays of threats of legal action,\u201d Westergren said. \n\nWardle added: \u201cI think some are reasonable.

The zero days were privately disclosed to Apple\u00a0by Citizen Lab, which is based at\nthe Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, and by mobile security company\nLookout.\u00a0Citizen Lab and Lookout published some technical details on how the vulnerabilities were\nused in iOS to spy on Ahmed Mansoor, an acclaimed activist in the UAE. \n\nMansoor, in early August, received suspicious and targeted text messages that included a link.\nMansoor passed the message on to contacts at Citizen Lab who analyzed the potential attack and\nconnected it to NSO Group. \n\nNSO Group\u2019s wares are not the first to be used against Mansoor; in 2011, FinFisher spyware and in\n2012, Hacking Team spyware were used against the human rights defender, Citizen Lab and Lookout\nsaid. \n\nApple yesterday patched two kernel vulnerabilities in OS X (Yosemite 10.10.5 and El Capitan\n10.11.6); CVE-2016-4655 discloses kernel memory, while CVE-2106-4656 is a memory corruption bug that\nexposes OS X to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges. \n\nOne vulnerability, CVE-2016-4657, was patched in Safari 9.1.3. The bug is in the WebKit\nimplementation in the browser where an attacker could lure the victim to a site hosting an exploit\nand be able to execute arbitrary code on the machine. \n\nIn iOS, the WebKit vulnerability was particularly dangerous since its allows for complete compromise\nwith just a click of a link, for example. Lookout said the kernel information leak vulnerability\nallows an attacker to learn kernel location in memory, while the second kernel bug allows for a\nsilent jailbreak of the device and the installation, in Mansoor\u2019s case, of surveillance software\ncalled Pegasus. \n\nNSO Group is alleged to have sold Pegasus to governments in order to spy on high-value targets. \n\nCitizen Lab said Mansoor was not the only one infected with Pegasus spyware; Mexican journalist\nRafael Cabrera had also been targeted. \n\n\u201cThis shows that some governments are willing to spend huge amounts of money to get into the minds\nand private communications of people who are in this sort of position,\u201d said Citizen Lab researcher\nJohn Scott-Railton in an interview with Threatpost. \u201cThis research shows the power of independent\norganizations like Citizen Lab doing work with dissidents and other groups that don\u2019t have the\nresources and money to pay for enterprise-grade security. Just because they can\u2019t defend themselves\nagainst it, doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be targets of sophisticated malware. Going forward we expect so\nsee more attacks of this type,\u201d he said. \n\niOS zero days have tremendous value in vulnerability markets. Exploit vendor Zerodium last September\nput up a month-long million-dollar bounty looking for iOS 9 zero-day vulnerabilities. The company,\nstarted by VUPEN founder Chaouki Bekrar, buys zero days for all major mobile and desktop platforms\nand for third-party software and said the attacks it purchases are built into a feed of\nvulnerabilities, exploits and defensive capabilities for its customers. Bekrar denied in a tweet\nthat the Apple zero days came from his company. \n\nThe iOS zero-days allegedly linked to NSO are Not ours and are Not related to @Zerodium, but thank\nyou for asking. #0days #WildWildWest \n\n\u2014 Chaouki Bekrar (@cBekrar) August 26, 2016 \n\n \n\nPegasus spyware, meanwhile, can be leveraged to spy on phone calls, SMS messages and media on the\ndevice such as the microphone or camera. Lookout researcher Andrew Blaich said that the zero days,\nor variants thereof, could have been used since 2013 dating back to iOS 7. \n\n", "polarity": 0.03640350877192983, "subjectivity": 0.39155701754385963, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/apple-fixes-vulnerabilities-across-os-x-ios-safari/119351/", "date": "2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Apple Fixes Vulnerabilities Across OS X, iOS, Safari", "body": "Apple fixed dozens of vulnerabilities in\u00a0its software\u00a0on Monday, including 60 vulnerabilities in its\noperating system, OS X, and 43 in its mobile operating system, iOS. \n\nThe OS X\u00a0update graduates\u00a0the\u00a0desktop and server operating system to OS X El Capitan v10.11.6 and\napplies to anyone running OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10.5, or OS X El Capitan v10.11. \n\nThe\u00a0updates mostly fix a number of glitches and bugs under the hood of the OS. As\u00a0usual, the bulk of\nthem apply to software libraries like OpenSSL, LibreSSL, and libxml2. Apple updated each library to\ntheir most recent versions to mitigate the issues. \n\nMeanwhile 21 of the vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution, six with kernel\nprivileges, and two that could go on and lead to the compromise of user information. \n\nSeven vulnerabilities \u2013 each one of them dug up by Ke Liu, of Tencent\u2019s Xuanwu Lab \u2013 exist in\nQuicktime. The bugs mostly stem from memory corruption issues and could allow malicious images to\ntrigger code execution. A nasty issue with libc++abi \u2013 an implementation for a C++ library, was\npatched that could have allowed an app to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. \n\nThe update also fixed an issue with Safari\u2019s Login Autofill feature that could have revealed a\nusers\u2019 password on screen. \n\nAn interesting bug involving Facetime was fixed in both OS X and iOS that could have allowed an\nattacker in a privileged network position\u00a0to get a relayed call to continue transmitting audio\nby\u00a0tricking a user into thinking the call had been terminated. \n\nAccording to Apple\u2019s advisory, \u201cuser interface inconsistencies\u201d existed when Facetime was handling\nrelayed calls.

Henry Feldman, an Assistant Professor\nof Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who also\u00a0runs the software development team for\nthe hospital\u2019s Division of Clinical Informatics discovered the bug could be caused by a malicious\ncalendar invite. \n\nBugs that affect Siri have been a dime a dozen since the personal assistant\u2019s inception. The latest,\ndiscovered by a\u00a0researcher in Portugal could have allowed anyone with physical access to someone\u2019s\ndevice to see private contact information. Apple fixed the issue, which stemmed from\u00a0the way Siri\nhandles Contact cards, through what it calls improved state management. \n\nAside from the Calendar app bug and the Siri bug, most of the iOS bugs, 12 in total, affect WebKit\nand could result in the exfiltration of data cross-origin, script execution, interface spoofing, and\nthe disclosure of process memory, to name a few outcomes. \n\nAs WebKit is the web browser engine used by Safari, the same 12 bugs fixed\u00a0in\u00a0the iOS update are\nalso fixed by the Safari update, which updates the browser to version 9.1.2. \n\nAs it usually does, Apple used the opportunity to release\u00a0updates\u00a0for both its watchOS and tvOS\noperating systems, along with iTunes.\u00a0The iTunes update only applies to Windows 7 users and\nupdates\u00a0the media player to version 12.4.2. \n\nThe updates are likely some of the last both OS X and iOS will receive in the near future as the\ncompany\u00a0has its hands full readying new versions, iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, for release later this\nfall.

Failing to\ndo so could expose your\u00a0devices to automated threats capable of rendering them unresponsive and\nperhaps\u00a0forever\u00a0useless.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2016, researcher Zach Straley posted a Youtube video exposing his startling and\nbizarrely simple discovery: Manually setting the date of your iPhone or iPad all the back to\nJanuary. 1, 1970 will permanently brick the device (don\u2019t try this at home, or against frenemies!).\n\nNow that Apple has patched the flaw that Straley exploited with his fingers, researchers say they\u2019ve\nproven how easy it would be to automate the attack over a network, so that potential victims would\nneed only to wander within range of a hostile wireless network to have their pricey Apple devices\nturned into useless bricks.\n\nNot long after Straley\u2019s video began pulling in millions of views, security researchers Patrick\nKelley and Matt Harrigan wondered: Could they automate the exploitation of this oddly severe and\ndestructive date bug?\u00a0The researchers discovered that\u00a0indeed they could, armed with\u00a0only $120 of\nelectronics (not counting the cost of the bricked iDevices), a basic understanding of networking,\nand a familiarity with the way Apple devices connect to wireless networks.\n\nApple products\u00a0like the iPad (and virtually all mass-market wireless devices) are designed to\nautomatically connect to wireless networks they have seen before. They do this with a relatively\nweak level of authentication: If you connect to a network named \u201cHotspot\u201d once, going forward your\ndevice may automatically connect to any open network that also happens to be called \u201cHotspot.\u201d\n\nFor example, to\u00a0use Starbuck\u2019s free Wi-Fi service, you\u2019ll have to connect to a network called\n\u201cattwifi\u201d. But once you\u2019ve done that, you won\u2019t ever have to manually connect to a network called\n\u201cattwifi\u201d ever again. The next time you visit a Starbucks, just pull out your iPad and the device\nautomagically connects.\n\nFrom an attacker\u2019s perspective, this is a golden opportunity. Why? He only needs to advertise a fake\nopen network called \u201cattwifi\u201d at a spot where large numbers of computer users are known to\ncongregate. Using specialized hardware to amplify his Wi-Fi signal, he can\u00a0force many\u00a0users to\nconnect to his (evil) \u201cattwifi\u201d hotspot. From there, he can attempt to inspect, modify or redirect\nany network traffic for any iPads or other devices that unwittingly connect to his evil network.\n\nAnd this is exactly what Kelley and Harrigan say they have done in real-life tests. They realized\nthat iPads and other iDevices constantly check various \u201cnetwork time protocol\u201d (NTP) servers around\nthe globe to sync their internal date and time clocks.\n\nThe researchers said they discovered they could build a hostile Wi-Fi network that would force Apple\ndevices to download time and date updates from their own (evil) NTP time server: And to set their\ninternal clocks to one infernal date and time in particular: January 1, 1970.\n\nThe result? The iPads that were brought within range of the test (evil) network\u00a0rebooted, and began\nto slowly self-destruct. It\u2019s not clear why they do this, but here\u2019s one possible explanation: Most\napplications on an iPad\u00a0are configured to use security certificates that encrypt data transmitted to\nand from the user\u2019s device. Those encryption certificates stop working correctly if the system time\nand date on the user\u2019s\u00a0mobile\u00a0is set to a year that predates the certificate\u2019s issuance.\n\nHarrigan and Kelley said this apparently creates havoc with most of the applications built into the\niPad and iPhone, and that the ensuing bedlam as applications on the device compete for resources\nquickly overwhelms the iPad\u2019s computer processing power. So much so that within minutes, they found\ntheir test iPad had reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 Celsius), as the date and clock settings on\nthe affected devices inexplicably and eerily began counting backwards.\n\nHarrigan, president and CEO of San Diego-based security firm PacketSled, described the meltdown\nthusly:\n\n\u201cOne thing we noticed was when we set the date on the iPad to 1970, the iPad display clock started\ncounting backwards. While we were plugging in the second test iPad 15 minutes later, the first iPad\nsaid it was Dec. 15, 1968. I looked at Patrick and was like, \u2018Did you mess with that thing?\u2019 He\nhadn\u2019t. It finally stopped at 1965, and by that time [the iPad] was about the temperature I like my\nsteak served at.\u201d\n\nKelley, a senior penetration tester with CriticalAssets.com, said he and Harrigan\u00a0worked with Apple\nto coordinate the release of their findings to ensure doing so didn\u2019t predate Apple\u2019s issuance of a\nfix for this vulnerability. The flaw is present in all Apple devices running anything lower than iOS\n9.3.1.\n\nApple did not respond to requests for comment. But an email shared by the researchers apparently\nsent by Apple\u2019s product security team suggests the company\u2019s researchers were unable to force an\naffected device to heat to more than 45.8 degrees Celcisus (~114 degrees Fahrenheit). The note read:\n\nAccording to Harrigan and Kelley, the hardware needed to execute this attack is little more than a\ncommon Raspberry Pi device with some custom software.\n\n\u201cBy spoofing time.apple.com, we were able to roll back the time and have it hand out to all Apple\nclients on the network,\u201d the researchers wrote in a paper shared with KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cAll test\ndevices took the update without question and rolled back to 1970.\u201d\n\nThe researchers continued: \u201cAn interesting side effect was that this caused almost all web browsing\ntraffic to cease working due to time mismatch. Typically, this would prompt a typical user to reboot\ntheir device. So, we did that. At this point, we could confirm that the reboot caused all iPads in\ntest to degrade gradually, beginning with the inability to unlock, and ultimately ending with the\ndevice overheating and not booting at all. Apple has confirmed this vulnerability to be present in\n64 bit devices that are running any version less than 9.3.1.\u201d\n\nHarrigan and Kelley say exploiting this bug on an Apple iPhone device is slightly trickier because\niPhones get their network time updates via GSM, the communications standard\u00a0the devices use to\nreceive and transmit\u00a0cell phone signals. But they said it may be possible to poison the date and\ntime on iPhones using updates fed to the devices via GSM.\n\nThey pointed to research by Brandon Creighton, a research architect at software testing firm\nVeracode who is perhaps best known for setting up the NinjaTel GSM mobile network at the massive\nDefCon security conference in 2012. Creighton\u2019s network relied on a technology called OpenBTS\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a\nsoftware based GSM access point. Harrigan and Kelley say an attacker could set up his own mobile\n(evil) network and push date and time updates to any phones that ping the evil tower.\n\n\u201cIt is completely plausible that this vulnerability is exploitable over GSM using OpenBTS or OpenBSC\nto set the time,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nCreighton agreed, saying that his own experience testing and running the NinjaTel network shows that\nit\u2019s theoretically possible, although he allows that he\u2019s never tried it.\n\n\u201cJust from my experimentation, theoretically from a protocol level you can do it,\u201d Creighton wrote\nin a note to\u00a0KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cBut there are lots of factors (the carrier; the parameters on the SIM\ncard; the phone\u2019s locked status; the kind of phone; the baseband version; previously joined\nnetworks; neighboring towers; RF signal strength; and more).\u00a0 If you\u2019re just trying to cause general\nchaos, you don\u2019t need to work very hard. But if, say, you were trying to target an individual\ndevice, it would require an additional amount of prep time/recon.\u201d\n\nWhether or not this attack could be used to remotely ruin iPhones or turn iPads into expensive\nskillets, it seems clear that failing to update to the latest version of Apple iOS is a less-than-\nstellar idea. iPad users who have not updated their OS need to be extremely cautious with respect to\njoining networks that they don\u2019t know or trust.\n\niOS and Mac OS X have a feature that allows users to prevent the devices from automatically joining\nwireless networks. Enabling this \u201cask to join networks\u201d feature blocks Apple devices from\nautomatically joining\u00a0networks they have never seen before\u00a0\u2014 but the side effect is that the device\nmay frequently\u00a0toss up prompts asking if you wish to join any one of several available wireless\nnetworks (this can be disabled by unselecting \u201cAsk to Join Networks\u201d). But enabling it doesn\u2019t\nprevent the device from connecting to, say, \u201cattwifi\u201d if it has previously connected to a network of\nthat name.\n\nThe researchers have posted a video on Youtube that explains their work in greater detail.\n\nUpdate, 1:08 p.m. ET: Added link to video and clarified how Apple\u2019s \u201cask to join networks\u201d feature\nworks.\n\n", "polarity": -0.003744798890429959, "subjectivity": 0.5092868700878408, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/02/the-lowdown-on-the-apple-fbi-showdown/", "date": "2016-02-22T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "The Lowdown on the Apple-FBI Showdown", "body": "Many readers have asked for a primer summarizing the privacy and security issues at stake in the the\ndispute between Apple and the U.S. Justice Department, which last week convinced a judge in\nCalifornia to order Apple to unlock an iPhone used by one of assailants in the recent\u00a0San Bernardino\nmassacres. I don\u2019t have much original reporting to contribute\u00a0on this important debate, but I\u2019m\nvisiting it here because it\u2019s a complex topic that deserves the broadest possible public scrutiny.\n\nA federal magistrate in California approved an order\u00a0(PDF) granting the FBI permission to access to\nthe data on the iPhone 5c belonging to the late terror suspect Syed Rizwan Farook, one of two\nindividuals responsible for a mass shooting in San Bernadino on Dec. 2, 2015\u00a0in which 14 people were\nkilled and many\u00a0others were injured.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook released a letter to customers last week saying the company will appeal the\norder, citing customer privacy and security concerns.\n\nMost experts seem to agree that Apple is technically capable of complying with the court order.\nIndeed, as National Public Radio notes in a segment this morning, Apple has agreed to unlock phones\nin approximately 70 other cases involving requests from the government. However, something\nunexpected emerged in one of those cases \u2014 an iPhone tied to a Brooklyn, NY drug dealer who pleaded\nguilty to selling methamphetamine last year.\n\nNPR notes that Apple might have complied with that request as well, had something unusual not\nhappened: Federal Magistrate Judge James Orenstein did not sign the order the government wanted, but\ninstead went public and asked Apple if the company had any objections.\n\n\u201cThe judge seemed particularly skeptical that the government relied in part on an 18th-century law\ncalled the All Writs Act,\u201d reports NPR\u2019s Joel Rose.\u00a0\u201cProsecutors say it gives them authority to\ncompel private companies to help carry out search warrants.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Apple is resisting this latest order, citing the precedent that complying might set,\nApple\u2019s CEO claims.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good,\u201d\nCook wrote. \u201cUp to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the\nlaw to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and\nsomething we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the\niPhone.\u201d\n\nCook continued: \u201cThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s\nsimply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of\ndevices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening\nhundreds of millions of locks \u2014 from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person\nwould find that acceptable.\u201d\n\nIn a letter posted to Lawfare.com and the FBI\u2019s home page, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged\nthat new technology creates serious tensions between privacy and safety, but said this tension\nshould be resolved by the U.S. courts \u2014 not by the FBI or by Apple.\n\n\u201cWe simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist\u2019s passcode without\nthe phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly,\u201d Comey\nsaid. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\nI hope thoughtful people will take the time to understand that. Maybe the phone holds the clue to\nfinding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn\u2019t. But we can\u2019t look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves\nin the mirror, if we don\u2019t follow this lead.\u201d\n\nAccording to the government,\u00a0Apple\u00a0has the capability to bypass the password on some of its devices,\nand can even disable an iPhone\u2019s optional auto-erase\u00a0function that is set to delete all data on the\nphone after some number of tries (the default is 10).\n\nThe iPhone at issue was an iPhone 5C, but it was running Apple\u2019s latest operating system, iOS 9\n(PDF), which prompts users to create six digit passcode for security. Since iOS 9 allows users to\nset a 4-digit, 6-digit or alphanumeric PIN, cracking the passcode on the assailant\u2019s iPhone could\ntake anywhere from a few hours to 5.5 years if the FBI used tools to \u201cbrute-force\u201d the code and\nwasn\u2019t hampered by the operating system\u2019s auto-erase feature. That\u2019s because the operating system\nbuilds in a tiny\u00a0time delay between each guess, rendering large scale brute-force attacks rather\ntime-consuming and potentially costly ventures.\n\nIn an op-ed that ran in The Washington Post on Feb. 18, noted security expert and cryptographer\nBruce Schneier notes that the authority the U.S. government seeks is probably available to the FBI\nif the agency wants to spring for the funding to develop the capability itself, and that\u00a0the FBI\nsees this as a privacy vs. security debate, while the tech community sees it as a security vs.\nsurveillance debate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing preventing the FBI from writing that hacked software itself, aside from budget and\nmanpower issues,\u201d Schneier wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe, in fact, that such hacked\nsoftware has been written by intelligence organizations around the world.\u201d\n\nSchneier said what the FBI wants to do would make us less secure, even though it\u2019s in the name of\nkeeping us safe from harm.\n\n\u201cThe danger is that the court\u2019s demands will pave the way to the FBI forcing Apple and others to\nreduce the security levels of their smart phones and computers, as well as the security of cars,\nmedical devices, homes, and everything else that will soon be computerized,\u201d Schneier wrote. \u201cThe\nFBI may be targeting the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter, but its actions imperil us all.\u201d\n\nNicholas Weaver,\u00a0a senior researcher in networking and security for the International Computer\nScience Institute (ICSI), said the same logic behind what the FBI seeks could just as easily apply\nto a mandate forcing Microsoft, Google, Apple, and others to push malicious code to a device through\nautomatic updates when the device isn\u2019t yet in law enforcement\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cThe request to Apple is accurately paraphrased as \u2018Create malcode designed to subvert security\nprotections, with additional forensic protections, customized for a particular target\u2019s phone,\ncryptographically sign that malcode so the target\u2019s phone accepts it as legitimate, and run that\ncustomized version through the update mechanism\u2019,\u201d Weaver wrote.\n\nApple appears ready to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court. If the courts decide in the\ngovernment\u2019s favor, the FBI won\u2019t soon be alone in requesting this authority, Weaver warns.\n\n\u201cAlmost immediately, the National Security Agency is going to secretly request the same authority\nthrough the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC),\u201d Weaver wrote. \u201cHow many honestly\nbelieve the FISC wouldn\u2019t rule in the NSA\u2019s favor after the FBI succeeds in getting the authority?\u201d\n\nThis debate will almost certainly be decided in the courts, perhaps even by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIn the meantime, lawmakers in Washington, D.C. are already positioning themselves to\u2026well, study the\nissue more.\n\nIn letters sent last week to Apple and the Justice Department, the House Energy & Commerce Committee\ninvited leaders of both organizations to come testify on the issue in an upcoming hearing. In\naddition, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) say they plan to unveil\nlegislation later this week to create a \u201cDigital Security Commission\u201d to investigate whether\nCongress has a bigger role to play here.\n\nTwitter addicts can follow this lively debate at the hashtag #FBIvsApple, although to be fair the\npro-Apple viewpoints appear to be far more represented so far.

The flaw, first revealed in an academic paper\u00a0(PDF) released\nby researchers from Indiana University, Peking University and the Georgia Institute of Technology,\ninvolves a vulnerability in Apple\u2019s latest operating system versions that enable an app approved for\ndownload by the Apple Store to gain unauthorized access to other apps\u2019 sensitive data.\n\n\u201cMore specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services, including the keychain\u2026can be\nexploited\u2026to steal such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and bank, and\nthe secret token of Evernote,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nThe team\u00a0said\u00a0they tested their findings by circumventing the restrictive security checks of the\nApple Store, and that their attack apps were approved by the App Store in January 2015. According to\nthe researchers,\u00a0more than 88 percent of apps were \u201ccompletely exposed\u201d to the attack.\n\nNews of the research was first reported by The Register, which said that\u00a0Apple was initially\nnotified in October 2014 and that in February 2015 the company asked researchers to hold off\ndisclosure for six months.\n\n\u201cThe team was able to raid banking credentials from Google Chrome on the latest Mac OS X 10.10.3,\nusing a sandboxed app to steal the system\u2019s keychain and secret iCloud tokens, and passwords from\npassword vaults,\u201d The Register wrote. \u201cGoogle\u2019s Chromium security team was more responsive and\nremoved Keychain integration for Chrome noting that it could likely not be solved at the application\nlevel. AgileBits, owner of popular software 1Password, said it could not find a way to ward off the\nattacks or make the malware \u2018work harder\u2019 some four months after disclosure.\u201d\n\nA story at\u00a09to5mac.com suggests the malware the researchers created to run their experiments can\u2019t\ndirectly access existing keychain entries, but instead does so indirectly by forcing users to log in\nmanually and then capturing those credentials in a newly-created entry.\n\n\u201cFor now, the best advice would appear to be cautious in downloading apps from unknown developers \u2013\neven from the iOS and Mac App Stores \u2013 and to be alert to any occasion where you are asked to login\nmanually when that login is usually done by Keychain,\u201d 9to5\u2019s Ben Lovejoy writes.\n\nSAMSUNG KEYBOARD FLAW\n\nSeparately, researchers at mobile security firm NowSecure disclosed they\u2019d found a serious\nvulnerability in a third-party keyboard app that is pre-installed on more than 600 million Samsung\nmobile devices \u2014 including the recently released Galaxy S6 \u2014 that allows attackers to remotely\naccess resources like GPS, camera and microphone, secretly install malicious apps, eavesdrop on\nincoming/outgoing messages or voice calls, and access pictures and text messages on vulnerable\ndevices.\n\nThe vulnerability in this case resides with an app called Swift keyboard, which according to\nresearcher Ryan Welton runs from a privileged account on Samsung devices. The flaw can be exploited\nif the attacker can control or compromise the network to which the device is connected, such as a\nwireless hotspot or local network.\n\n\u201cThis means that the keyboard was signed with Samsung\u2019s private signing key and runs in one of the\nmost privileged contexts on the device, system user, which is a notch short of being root,\u201d Welton\nwrote in a blog post about the flaw, which was first disclosed at Black Hat London on Tuesday, along\nthe release of proof-of-concept code.\n\nWelton said NowSecure alerted Samsung in November 2014, and that at the end of March Samsung\nreported a patch released to mobile carriers for Android 4.2 and newer, but requested an additional\nthree months deferral for public disclosure. Google\u2019s Android security team was alerted in December\n2014.\n\n\u201cWhile Samsung began providing a patch to mobile network operators in early 2015, it is unknown if\nthe carriers have provided the patch to the devices on their network,\u201d Welton said.\u00a0\u201cIn addition, it\nis difficult to determine how many mobile device users remain vulnerable, given the devices models\nand number of network operators globally.\u201d NowSecure has released a list of Samsung devices indexed\nby carrier and their individual patch status.\n\nSamsung issued a statement saying it takes emerging security threats very seriously.\n\n\u201cSamsung KNOX has the capability to update the security policy of the phones, over-the-air, to\ninvalidate any potential vulnerabilities caused by this issue. The security policy updates will\nbegin rolling out in a few days,\u201d the company said. \u201cIn addition to the security policy update, we\nare also working with SwiftKey to address potential risks going forward.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Google said the company took steps to mitigate the issue with the release of\nAndroid 5.0 in November 2014.\n\n\u201cAlthough these are most accurately characterized as application level issues, back with Android\n5.0, we took proactive measures to reduce the risk of the issues being exploited,\u201d Google said in a\nstatement emailed to KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cFor the longer term, we are also in the process of reaching\nout to developers to ensure they follow best practices for secure application development.\u201d\n\nSwiftKey released a statement emphasizing that the company only became aware of the problem this\nweek, and that it does not affect its keyboard applications available on Google Play or Apple App\nStore. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to support our long-time partner Samsung in their efforts to\nresolve this important security issue,\u201d SwiftKey said in a blog post.\n\nUpdate: SwiftKey\u2019s Jennifer Kutz\u00a0suggests that it\u2019s\u00a0incorrect to use the phrase \u201cpre-installed app\u201d\nto describe the component that Samsung ships with its devices:\u00a0\u201cA pre-installed app is definitely\ndifferent from how we work with Samsung, who licenses/white-labels our technology \u2013 or prediction\nengine \u2013 to power their devices\u2019 default/stock keyboards,\u201d Kutz said. \u201cThe keyboard is not branded\nas SwiftKey, and the functionality between our Google Play app, or pre-installed SwiftKey app, is\ndifferent from what Samsung users have (in short, the official SwiftKey app has a much more robust\nfeature set). The SwiftKey SDK powers the word predictions \u2013 it\u2019s a core part of our technology but\nit is not our full app.\u201d\n\n", "polarity": 0.11030883367839892, "subjectivity": 0.5021221532091097, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/apple-pay-bridging-online-and-big-box-fraud/", "date": "2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Apple Pay: Bridging Online and Big Box Fraud", "body": "Lost amid the media firestorm these past few weeks about fraudsters turning to Apple Pay is this\nstark and rather unsettling reality: Apple Pay makes\u00a0it possible for cyber thieves to buy high-\npriced merchandise from\u00a0brick-and-mortar stores using\u00a0stolen credit and debit card numbers that were\nheretofore only useful for online fraud.\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on here, a\u00a0quick primer on card fraud is probably in order.\u00a0If you\u2019re a\nfraudster and you wish to walk into a Best Buy store and walk out with a big screen TV or xBox\nconsole on someone else\u2019s dime, you\u2019re going to buy \u201cdumps,\u201d which are data stolen straight off the\nmagnetic stripe on the backs of\u00a0cards.\n\nTypically, dumps are\u00a0stolen\u00a0via malware planted on point-of-sale devices, as in the breaches at\nbrick-and-mortar stores like Target, Home Depot and countless others over the past year. Dumps\nbuyers encode the data onto new plastic, which they then use \u201cin-store\u201d at retailers and walk out\nwith armloads full of high-priced goods that can be easily resold for cash. The average price of a\nsingle dump is between $10-$30, but the payoff in stolen merchandise per card is often many times\nthat amount.\n\nWhen fraudsters want to order something online using stolen credit cards, they go buy what the\ncrooks call \u201cCVVs\u201d \u2014 i.e., card data stolen from hacked online stores. CVV stands for \u201ccard\nverification code,\u201d and refers to the three-digit code on the back of cards that\u2019s required for most\nonline transactions. Fraudsters buying CVVs get\u00a0the credit card number, the expiration date, the\ncard verification code, as well as the cardholder\u2019s name, address and phone number. Because they\u2019re\nless versatile\u00a0than dumps, CVVs cost quite a bit less \u2014 typically around $1-$5 per stolen account.\n\nSo in summary, dumps are stolen from main-street merchants, and are sought after by crooks mainly\nfor use at main street merchants. CVVs, on the other hand, are stolen from online stores, and are\nuseful only for fraud against online stores.\n\nEnter Apple Pay, which potentially erases that limitation of CVVs because it allows users to sign up\nonline for an in-store payment method using little more than a hacked iTunes account and CVVs.\nThat\u2019s because most banks that are enabling Apple Pay for their customers do little, if anything,\u00a0to\nrequire that customers prove they have the physical card in their possession.\n\nAvivah Litan, a fraud analyst with Gartner Inc. explained\u00a0a blog post published earlier this month\nthat Apple provides banks with a fair amount of data to aid banks in their efforts at \u201cidentity\nproofing\u201d the customer, such as device name, its current geographic location, and whether or not the\ncustomer has a long history of transactions with iTunes.\n\nAll useful data points, of course,\u00a0unless\u00a0the iTunes account that all of this information is based\non is hijacked by fraudsters. And as we know from previous stories on this blog, there is a robust\ntrade in the cybercrime underground for hijacked iTunes accounts, which retail for about $8 per\naccount.\n\nLitan\u2019s column continues:\n\nSure, the banks could pressure Apple Pay to make their users take a picture of their credit cards\nwith the iPhone and upload that data before signing up. That might work for a short while to deter\nfraud, at least until the people at underground document forgery sites like Scanlab see a new market\nfor their services.\n\nBut in the end, most banks coming online with Apple Pay are still using customer call centers to\nvalidate new users, leveraging\u00a0data that can be purchased very cheaply from underground identity\ntheft sites. If any of you doubt how easy it is to buy personal data on just about anyone, check out\nthe story I wrote in December 2014, wherein I was able to find the name, address, Social Security\nnumber, previous address and phone number on all current members of the U.S. Senate Commerce\nCommittee.\n\nThe irony here is that while Apple Pay has been touted as a more secure alternative to paying with a\ncredit card, the way Apple and the banks have implemented it actually makes card fraud cheaper and\neasier for fraudsters.\n\nEven more deliciously ironic, as noted in Cherian Abraham\u2018s insightful column at Droplabs,\u00a0is how\nmuch of the fraud stemming from crooks signing up stolen credit cards with Apple Pay was tied to\npurchases of high-dollar Apple products at Apple\u2019s own brick-and-mortar stores!\u00a0That banks end up\neating the fraud costs from this activity is just the cherry on top.\n\nAbraham said the banks are in this mess because they didn\u2019t demand more transparency and\ntraceability from Apple\u00a0before rushing to sign customers up (or \u201cprovision\u201d them, in banker-speak)\nfor Apple Pay.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest gripes I have heard from issuers is the lack of transparency from Apple (what\ndid they expect?) and the makeshift reporting provided to issuers that is proving to be woefully\ninadequate,\u201d Abaraham wrote. \u201cAs long as issuers fall back on measures easily circumvented by freely\navailable PII \u2013 this problem will continue to leech trust and large sums of cash.\u00a0And alongside of\nthe latter, there is much blame to go around as well.\u201d\n\nBoth Abraham and Gartner\u2019s Litan say banks need to take a step back and take the time to develop\nmore robust, thoughtful and scalable solutions to identity proofing customers, particularly as other\nmobile providers begin rolling out their mobile payment systems without the customer data advantages\nthat Apple has in their relatively closed environment.\n\n\u201cThe vendors in the mobile user authentication space have consistently answered that they are\nleaving account provisioning policies to the banks or other consumer service providers provisioning\nthe apps,\u201d Litan wrote. \u201cWell maybe it\u2019s time for them to reconsider and start helping their client\nbanks and service providers by supporting identity proofing solutions built into their apps. Whoever\ndoes this well is surely going to win lots of customer support\u2026 and revenue.\u201d\n\n", "polarity": 0.1500827149041435, "subjectivity": 0.4291920050848621, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/apple-releases-patches-for-shellshock-bug/", "date": "2014-09-30T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Apple Releases Patches for Shellshock Bug", "body": "Apple has released updates to insulate Mac OS X systems from the dangerous \u201cShellshock\u201d bug, a\npervasive vulnerability that is already being exploited in active attacks.\n\nPatches\u00a0are available via Software Update, or from the following links for OS X Mavericks, Mountain\nLion, and Lion.\n\nAfter installing the updates, Mac users can check to see whether the flaw has been truly fixed by\ntaking the following steps:\n\n* Open Terminal, which you can find in the\u00a0Applications folder (under the Utilities subfolder on\nMavericks) or via Spotlight search.\n\n* Execute this command: bash \u2013version [author\u2019s note: my WordPress install is combining these two\ndashes; it should read the word \u201cbash\u201d followed by a space, then two dashes, and the word\n\u201cversion\u201d].\n\n* The version after applying this update will be:\n\nOS X Mavericks:\u00a0 GNU bash, version 3.2.53(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin13) OS X Mountain Lion:\nGNU bash, version 3.2.53(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin12) OS X Lion:\u00a0 GNU bash, version\n3.2.53(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin11)\n\n", "polarity": -0.03333333333333332, "subjectivity": 0.4, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/", "date": "2011-11-23T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Apple Took 3+ Years to Fix FinFisher Trojan Hole", "body": "The Wall Street Journal this week ran an excellent series on government surveillance tools in the\ndigital age. One story looked at FinFisher, a remote spying Trojan that was marketed to the\ngovernments of Egypt, Germany and other nations to permit surreptitious PC and mobile phone\nsurveillance by law enforcement officials. The piece noted that FinFisher\u2019s creators advertised the\nability to deploy the Trojan disguised as an update for Apple\u2019s iTunes media player, and that Apple\nlast month fixed the vulnerability that the Trojan leveraged.\n\nBut the WSJ series and other media coverage of the story have overlooked one small but crucial\ndetail: A prominent security researcher warned Apple about this dangerous vulnerability in mid-2008,\nyet the company waited more than 1,200 days to fix the flaw.\n\nThe disclosure raises questions about whether and when Apple knew about the Trojan offering, and its\ntiming in choosing to sew up the security hole in this ubiquitous software title: According to\nApple, as of June 2011, there were approximately a quarter billion installations of iTunes\nworldwide.\n\nApple did not respond to requests for comment. An email sent Wednesday morning to its press team\nproduced an auto-response stating that employees were already on leave for the Thanksgiving holiday\nin the United States.\n\nI first wrote about this vulnerability for The Washington Post in July 2008, after interviewing\nArgentinian security researcher Francisco Amato about \u201cEvilgrade,\u201d a devious new penetration testing\ntool he had developed. The toolkit was designed to let anyone send out bogus automatic update alerts\nto users of software titles that don\u2019t sign their updates. I described the threat from this toolkit\nin greater detail:\n\nEvilgrade leveraged a flaw in the updater mechanism for iTunes that could be exploited on Windows\nsystems. Amato described the vulnerability:\n\n\u201cThe iTunes program checks that the binary is signed by Apple but we can inject content into the\ndescription as it opens a browser, with a malicious binary so that the user thinks its from Apple,\u201d\nAmato said of his attack tool.\n\nEmails shared with KrebsOnSecurity show that Amato contacted Apple\u2019s security team on July 11, 2008,\nto warn them that the iTunes update functionality could be abused to push out malicious software.\nAccording to Amato, Apple acknowledged receipt of the report shortly thereafter, but it did not\ncontact him about his findings until Oct. 28, 2011, when it sent an email to confirm his name and\ntitle for the purposes of crediting him with reporting the flaw in its iTunes 10.5.1 patch release\ndetails. Interestingly, Apple chose to continue to ignore the vulnerability even after Amato shipped\na significant feature upgrade to Evilgrade in Oct. 2010.\n\nThe length of time Apple took to patch this significant security flaw is notable. In May 2006, I\nundertook a longitudinal study of how long it took Apple to ship security updates for its products.\nIn that analysis, I looked at two years\u2019 worth of patches issued to fix serious security bugs in\nApple\u2019s Mac OS X operating system, as well as other Apple software applications like iTunes. I found\nthat on average, 91 days elapsed between the date that a security researcher alerted Apple to an\nunpatched flaw and the date Apple shipped a patch to fix the problem. In that study, I examined\npatch times for four dozen flaws, and the lengthiest patch time in that period was 245 days.\n\nAmato said he\u2019s not sure why Apple took so long to fix his bug, which he said should have been\ntrivial to correct.\n\n\u201cMaybe they forgot about it, or it was just on the bottom of their to-do list,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic attention to digital surveillance tools being marketed to law enforcement agencies worldwide\nis spurring discussion about whether antivirus companies are doing all they can to unmask these\nintruders. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer for Finnish security firm F-Secure, first blogged\nabout FinFisher in March 2011, when protesters in Egypt took over the headquarters of the Egyptian\nState Security and gained access to loads of confidential state documents, including those that\nappear to show the government purchased licenses for the program.\n\nHypponen said F-Secure has stated unequivocally that it will detect any malware that it knows about,\nregardless of whether the malware is being actively used by government authorities for surveillance.\nBut he said not all antivirus companies have made similar public commitments.\n\n\u201cThere is no real discussion or industry-wide agreement on it,\u201d Hypponen said. \u201cThe way it goes down\nis that [antivirus] companies have no idea which Trojans they get are governmental Trojans or just\nthe usual stuff. There must be many more governmental Trojans that we and others detect but don\u2019t\nknow are being used for government surveillance.\u201d\n\nAs for the years that Apple took to patch the iTunes update flaw, Hypponen said he\u2019s stumped, but\ninclined to give the company the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cIt is an unusually long time to patch anything, so it doesn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more details on FinFisher, see Der Spiegel\u2019s fascinating coverage of how this surveillance\nTrojan was marketed.\n\nOne note of caution about upgrading your software that I hope is clear from this post: Staying up-\nto-date with the latest security patches is one of the surest ways to keep your system secure from\nmalware and intruders. But whenever possible, try to do your updating from a network that you trust\nand control. Otherwise, you may be placing far too much trust in the security of the update\nmechanisms built into the software you use.\n\nUpdate, 3:11 p.m. ET: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Amato was able to\nexploit the iTunes update flaw on OS X systems. While Apple\u2019s advisory states that this flaw is\npresent on OS X systems that lack the iTunes 10.5.1 patch, Amato said he was unable to replicate the\nproblem on OS X systems during his research.\n\n", "polarity": 0.10252984389348026, "subjectivity": 0.469981634527089, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}]
