This summer, with\nthe planned release of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, users should see signs that the weak\ncryptographic hash function is being phased out. \n\nMicrosoft said that once the anniversary update is rolled out, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer\nwill no longer display the lock icon in the address bar for any site signed with a SHA-1\ncertificate. \n\nDevelopers should see this happening soon in the Windows Insider Preview build, Microsoft said. \n\nLast November, Microsoft hinted that it would starting blocking SHA-1 signed TLS certificates this\nJune, moving up its scheduled deprecation of SHA-1 by more than six months. By February 2017,\nMicrosoft said last week, Edge and IE will block SHA-1 certs outright. \n\n\u201cThis update will be delivered to Microsoft Edge on Windows 10\u00a0and Internet Explorer 11 on Windows\n7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, and will only impact certificates that chain to a CA in the Microsoft\nTrusted Root Certificate program,\u201d Microsoft said in an announcement posted by the Microsoft Edge\nteam. \u201cBoth Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 will provide additional details in the F12\nDeveloper Tools console to assist site administrators and developers.\u201d \n\nCryptographers and mathematicians have been inching toward practical collision attacks against SHA-1\nfor close to a decade. Collision attacks happen when two separate inputs for a hash function\ngenerate the same hash, allowing an attacker to forge certificates and nudge malware and attacks\nonto systems as legitimate operations. \n\nMicrosoft is not the only technology provider to steer clear of SHA-1. Google, last December,\nannounced its deprecation timeline and already by January of this year, users were seeing error\nmessages displayed if Chrome encountered a SHA-1 signed certificate. It promises that by Jan. 1,\n2017\u2014or perhaps by the end of June coinciding with Microsoft\u2019s early deprecation\u2014SHA-1 will be\nblocked in Chrome. \n\nMozilla is on the same Jan. 1 2017 timeline as well, after announcing in 2014 that it would no\nlonger trust SHA-1 in Firefox. \n\nThe accelerated timelines are a direct result of advances in SHA-1 collision attack research,\nnudging these attacks from the theoretical to the practical. The final dagger came last October in a\npaper called \u201cFreestart collision for full SHA-1\u201d that describes how current attacks can be modified\nto drastically reduce the cost and time to arrive at a SHA-1 collision. \n\nThe researchers estimated that their attack could, with modern cloud computing resources, be\naccomplished in fewer than three months at a cost of up to $120,000 USD. That\u2019s a drastic reduction\nfrom a 2012 paper that projected a practical collision would be possible by 2018 at a cost of\n$143,000. Government or criminal organizations with any measure of decent funding could pull off\nthis type of attack today, experts guess. \n\nCollision attacks against MD5 have been demonstrated in the wild, forcing an accelerated deprecation\nof that hash function. The most notorious MD5 collision was pulled off by the attackers behind the\nFlame malware. They were able to leverage the collision to sign malware as if it were coming from\nMicrosoft, and as a result, would be trusted. The Flame attackers used the forged Microsoft digital\ncertificate to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against victims, impersonating the Windows Update\nmechanism and installing malicious code instead. \n\n", "polarity": 0.05863095238095238, "subjectivity": 0.43273809523809526, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/nano-server-added-to-microsoft-bug-bounty-program/117778/", "date": "2016-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Nano Server Added to Microsoft Bug Bounty Program", "body": "Microsoft is accelerating the fumigation of bugs on its soon-to-be released Windows Server 2016\noperating system.

The remaining flaw occurs because of how Edge accesses objects in memory,\nleading to corruption and arbitrary code execution. \n\nAnother bulletin worth watching is MS16-054, which includes patches for four remote code execution\nflaws in Microsoft Office. In addition to Office, Microsoft cautioned that versions of Word going\nback to Office 2007 are vulnerable to CVE-2016-0198, one of three memory corruption flaws addressed\nin this bulletin.

The remaining vulnerability is in Office Graphics, specifically in the way the\nWindows font library handles specially crafted embedded fonts. An attacker could exploit this over\nthe web, or share the file with a user via email or IM, for example. \n\nMicrosoft also patched a critical remote code execution flaw in Windows Journal in MS16-056.

Olson said he has\nnever seen this technique before, but there is nothing remarkable about the macro. \u201cThe Microsoft\nfind is yet another iteration of a macro that uses a slightly different technique to evade\ndetection.\u201d He said the technique is slick, but par for the course in the whack-a-mole arms race to\ntrick and detect macros. \n\nAccording to Palo Alto, macro attacks are on the rise. This year Palo Alto reports 1.2 million\ninstances of the Bartallex family of malware delivered via malicious macro documents. That\u2019s up from\nlast year with 100,000 instances of Bartallex family macro malware. \n\n\u201cWe suspect that macro-based attacks are experiencing a resurgence from the late 1990s. There are a\nwhole new pool of victims that don\u2019t remember how dangerous macros were and are learning the hard\nway to never trust macros unless sent from a 100 percent reliable source,\u201d Olson said. \n\n", "polarity": 0.014131701631701622, "subjectivity": 0.41366550116550116, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-deploys-macro-blocking-feature-in-office-to-curb-malware/116960/", "date": "2016-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Microsoft Deploys Macro Blocking Feature in Office to Curb Malware", "body": "If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. If there\u2019s one thing the recent surge in threats using macros to\nspread malware has shown, it\u2019s that the vector is clearly working for attackers. \n\nDevelopers at Microsoft hope a feature in the latest version of Microsoft Office will reduce the\nfrequency of those attacks by giving administrators the ability to block macros from running on\nmachines on their network. \n\nWhile macros \u2013 a series of commands stored in documents \u2013 are\u00a0disabled by default on most networks,\nduplicitous hackers have taken to using email subject lines having to do with invoices and HR as\nphishing lures to get victims to open documents and enable them. \n\nAccording to a post on the company\u2019s Threat Research and Response blog this week the new macro\nblocking feature can be enabled on Word, Excel, and Powerpoint \u2013 either via a Group Policy, or on an\nindividual basis. \n\nThe feature, which can be found in Office\u2019s Group Policy Management Console for Office 2016, allows\nadmins to scope macro use to a set of trusted workflows, and block users\u2019 ability to enable macros\nin scenarios it considers high risk.\u00a0If a user attempts to enable macros in a document, they\u2019re\ngiven a stricter notification, a red bar, warning them that macros have been disabled for security\nreasons. \n\n \n\n\u201cThis feature relies on the security zone information that Windows uses to specify trust associated\nwith a specific location. For example, if the location where the file originates from is considered\nthe Internet zone by Windows, then macros are disabled in the document,\u201d the post reads. \n\nThe company claims the mechanism should help thwart attacks spread in attachments from emails sent\noutside the organization, from documents downloaded from storage sites, like Dropbox and Google\nDrive, and from documents opened from public shares. \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Malware Protection Center first warned of campaigns beginning to use the old school\ntechnique again\u00a0back in January 2015, claiming that over the course of December 2014 infections\nspiked to 8,000 on some days. \n\nSince then, the technique has flourished and attackers have begun leveraging macros in document\nfiles to drop the banking Trojan Dridex, bots like Kasidet, and as of late, ransomware like Locky.\nWhile \n\nEarlier this year attackers working with the BlackEnergy APT group were spotted using Word documents\nto drop payloads on Ukrainian users. The group is no stranger to using Office files; in the past\nthey\u2019ve also used\u00a0weaponized Excel and Powerpoint documents to trick users into spreading\ninfections. \n\n \n\nAccording to stats from Microsoft\u2019s Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection service, the\noverwhelming majority of threats that target Office, 98 percent, are macros-based. \n\nTaking the uptick in infections into account, the company is urging enterprise admins to turn on the\nmacro-blocking feature if they haven\u2019t already done so and turn off any workflows that involve macro\nusage. \n\n\u201cThis is the most comprehensive mitigation that you can implement today.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.08628507295173961, "subjectivity": 0.38837822671155997, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-june-patch-tuesday-fixes-44-vulnerabilities/118664/", "date": "2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Microsoft June Patch Tuesday Fixes 44 Vulnerabilities", "body": "Microsoft pushed out 16 bulletins on Tuesday addressing 44 different vulnerabilities in its\nsoftware, including Windows, Exchange Server, Office, Edge, and Internet Explorer. \n\nFive of the bulletins have been branded critical because\u00a0each vulnerability associated with them\ncould be used to carry out remote code execution; the remaining 11 are marked important. \n\nAccording to experts, one of the more concerning critical fixes involves a use after free\nvulnerability that affects Microsoft Windows DNS server for Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2. If an\nattacker sent a specially crafted request to a DNS server, they could convince it to run arbitrary\ncode, Microsoft\u2019s advisory warns. \n\n\u201cOrganizations that run their DNS server on the same machine as their Active Directory server need\nto be doubly aware of the danger of this vulnerability,\u201d Wolfgang Kandek, CTO at Qualys, warned\nTuesday afternoon. \n\nMicrosoft fixed the issue by modifying how the servers handle requests. Users should update but\nsince most Windows DNS servers don\u2019t\u00a0face the internet and most admins use them for internal traffic\nthe issue shouldn\u2019t be an immediate concern. \n\nAnother critical issue, MS16-070, affects Microsoft Office and could allow an attacker to run\narbitrary code and take control of an affected system if the user was logged on with admin rights.\nAn attacker could trigger an exploit merely by sending a Microsoft Word RTF file to a user.\nMicrosoft acknowledges the preview pane is an attack vector and that the flaw could be triggered\nwith a simple e-mail without user interaction. \n\nIf for some reason users can\u2019t apply the patches for MS16-070 right away, as a workaround, Microsoft\nis encouraging users to\u00a0use\u00a0Office\u2019s File Block policy to prevent Office from opening .RTF documents\nfrom unknown or untrusted sources. \n\nTwo more of the critical bulletins, cumulative security updates for\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s browsers Internet\nExplorer and Edge,\u00a0address multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities. \n\nIn Edge, the browser\u2019s Content Security Policy fails to properly validate some documents and the\nChakra JavaScript engine has difficulty rendering when it handles objects in memory.

ZDI paid out nearly $2 million in rewards in 2016, the group\nreported this week.\n\nAs for the bigger software vulnerability picture, Adobe products accounted for 149 of advisories, or\n22% of the ZDI total, same as in 2015. Adobe Reader, Acrobat, and Flash were the main culprits, and\nZDI expects the trend to continue as more browsers block Flash by default. In addition, Adobe\ndoesn't operate its own bounty program for bugs and vulnerabilities, unlike Microsoft and Apple. And\nAdobe is already off to an auspicious start in 2017; ZDI communications manager Dustin Childs tells\nDark Reading his organization just notified the vendor of eight new vulnerabilities.\n\nMicrosoft fell to number three on ZDI's 2016 list and it had a lower percentage of published ZDI\nadvisories - 11% - down from the previous year's 17%. But those numbers don't tell the whole story,\nsince Microsoft itself published more security bulletins in 2016 than ever before. Microsoft's\nbiggest problem was the continued targeting of browsers; while its Edge browser was supposed to be\nmuch more secure than Internet Explorer, almost two-thirds (64%) of Microsoft-related ZDI advisories\nwere related to browsers.\n\nAdvisories for Apple products made a significant jump in 2016. There were 61 ZDI advisories posted\nfor the vendor's products in 2016, or 9% of the total, more than what it posted in 2014 and 2015 \u2013\n4% both years. The jump isn't completely surprising to Childs, who notes Apple's more pervasive\npresence with desktop computing, not to mention its smartphone dominance. The installed base of OSX\nand iOS combined is larger than Windows, Childs adds, and predicts more Apple vulnerabilities in\n2017 through ZDI and Apple's own bug bounty program.\n\nTrend Micro, which owns ZDI, also predicts the percentage of Microsoft advisories will continue to\ndrop in 2017 while Apple's increase.\n\nIndustrial computing vendor Advantech made its debut on the ZDI list at number two with 112\nadvisories published \u2013 17% of the published advisories. \"This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean this vendor\nhas a wide surface attack area,\" Childs writes in a ZDI blog post. \"All of these cases came in\nthrough the same anonymous researcher, meaning the researcher found a specific type of bug prevalent\nin their systems,\" Childs says, adding that the same researcher reported no bugs from any other\nvendor in 2016.\n\nWhile Advantech's issues were a surprise, Childs says he also expected to see more enterprise\nsoftware cropping up on the 2016 list from vendors like HP, Dell, or Oracle. \"There's a bunch of\nenterprise software that hasn't been closely looked at, so there's a lot of bugs for researchers to\nfind,\" he says. And though browsers have become well-trod territory, this business middleware market\nis mostly untouched.\n\nNonetheless, infosec professionals and executives should be careful with lists like these, since\nlooking at the numbers without much context doesn\u2019t make for better security decisions in the\nfuture, warns Jeremiah Grossman, a security researcher and chief of security strategy at\nSentinelOne.\n\n\"These figures see significant and subjective variation in what\u2019s included, how things are counted,\nand more, which can largely throw off the numbers from one year to the next,\" he tells Dark Reading\nin an email. \"And of course cybercriminals really don\u2019t care how many reported vulns a particular\nproduct has, mostly because they only need one (or maybe a small handful) that\u2019s wired into their\nexploitation tools for easy deployment.\"\n\nChilds counters that it's important to understand how ZDI's list get compiled. \"It's important to\nsee how the list is created - these are the bugs coming through our program,\" he says. \"They may not\nbe representative of all the research going on\u2026 we don't do anything with mobile yet, for example.\nBut if you look back at the last couple years, you can definitely see some trends,\" like Adobe's\nrecurring presence.\n\n", "polarity": 0.16762656325156328, "subjectivity": 0.5040473184223182, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/iot/microsoft-launches-security-program-for-azure-iot/d/d-id/1327350", "date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Kelly Sheridan", "title": "Microsoft Launches Security Program For Azure IoT", "body": "Microsoft has launched a new program for its Azure cloud platform to help business customers\nstrengthen their security posture amid the rise of the Internet of Things.\n\nSecurity and privacy concerns are top of mind for IT pros as the IoT continues to grow within the\nenterprise.

But it also comes with some risks.\n\nOctober 11 marked the first time Microsoft released updates via its new system, which combines\nsecurity and non-security fixes into large bundles. Three distinct update bundles will roll out each\nmonth; two available to enterprise customers, and one for consumers.\n\nOn the second Tuesday of each month, otherwise known as Patch Tuesday, Microsoft will distribute two\nupdate batches.\n\nOne of these, for businesses and consumers, is released via Windows Update, Windows Server Update\nServices (WSUS), and the Windows Update Catalog. This is a monthly rollup of security and non-\nsecurity fixes, which contains all updates for the month as well as fixes for the previous months.\nIf a user skips a month, they will receive the patches for that month in the following month's\nbundle.\n\nThe second bundle contains all security patches for the specific month and excludes fixes from\nprevious months. These security-only rollouts, intended for enterprise users, are distributed\nthrough WSUS and Windows Update Catalog.\n\n\"What Microsoft is trying to do is make things simpler for users by delivering all updates\ntogether,\" explains Amol Sarwate, director of vulnerability labs at Qualys. \"When administrators\ninstall patches, they can just deploy one patch.\" This model also makes it easier to learn which\nfixes are included and which aren't, he adds.\n\nOn the third Tuesday, Microsoft will release a preview of non-security updates slated to arrive in\nthe following month's rollup. This allows businesses to test updates on their systems and verify\ncompatibility.\n\nSarwate explains how this new strategy is intended to streamline the update process for enterprise\ncustomers and give them the option to choose specific bundles. He advises organizations to take\nadvantage of the opportunity to test new updates ahead of their release.\n\nMicrosoft's new update model also addresses problems businesses previously encountered when applying\nnew security fixes.\n\n\"The main issue in the past has been that some users, mostly by mistake, didn't install all\npatches,\" explains Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at SANS Technology Institute. \"This led to a\nvery fragmented user base and increased the risk of new patches, as you couldn't be sure that all\nold patches were applied correctly.\"\n\nBusiness systems are more tightly managed, he continues, and decisions are more carefully made as\npart of a controlled patch process. Organizations can delay patches for a particular month if they\nconflict with business-critical apps.\n\nThe Tradeoffs\n\nWhile the change is intended to make patching simpler for enterprise users, experts agree there is\nstill risk involved.\n\n\"As someone who manages patching, I welcome the change,\" says Michael Gray, VP of tech at Thrive\nNetworks. \"The time spent researching every patch is exhaustive.\"\n\nHowever, he continues, there is a risk of people not wanting to download these monolithic updates.\nWhat's more, the larger these bundles get, the more likely it is someone could compromise the entire\npackage.\n\nUllrich acknowledges the new model will make patch application easier, but there is also risk\nrelated to availability.\n\n\"If a particular patch interferes with a particular function of the PC, either a hardware component\nor customer software, then the entire patch has to be delayed and it will not be advisable to just\napply a partial patch,\" he explains.\n\nThis further emphasizes the importance of patch testing, which may be a bit easier on the new system\nsince there will be less variability, he continues. However, it remains to be seen how this will\nwork out in the first few months of Microsoft's new model.\n\nAs IT managers begin to roll out these changes, they should keep standard patching best practices in\nmind, says Sarwate. He recommends deploying updates in waves, so if there's a need to roll back,\nit's only necessary for a small group of workers.\n\nUllrich advises corporations to apply patches as soon as Microsoft releases them. Home users should\nstill automatically apply patches.\n\n", "polarity": 0.09771645021645024, "subjectivity": 0.4001791726791725, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-adds-technical-updates-to-sdl-site/d/d-id/1328275", "date": "2017-02-27T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Dark Reading Staff", "title": "Microsoft Adds Technical Updates to SDL Site", "body": "Microsoft has released a new wave of updates and technical content additions for its Security\nDevelopment Lifecycle (SDL) website, which contains resources for securely developing and testing\nsoftware.\n\nThese changes affect the SDL Developer Starter Kit, security tooling guidance, and compiler and\ncryptographic recommendations.

In\nannouncing the extension, Microsoft for the first time also disclosed plans about finally pulling\nthe plug on a technology that has served as an important bulwark against malicious exploits for many\nWindows organizations for the past. But its new deadline of July 2018 at least gives organizations\n18 months to prepare for it.\n\nMicrosoft introduced EMET in 2009 as a measure to help enterprises mitigate and manage security\nvulnerabilities in Windows. Among other things, the company intended for the free toolkit to be used\nby administrators to activate settings and security features that were not always enabled by default\nin Windows and for locking down application access to OS features that they didn\u2019t need.\n\nAt the time, Microsoft had described EMET as a necessary toolkit to help secure their Windows\nenvironment in the three- to four years it used to take the company to release new and updated\nWindows versions. Over the years, administrators have used the technology to thwart everything from\nordinary exploits to advanced zero-day threats.\n\n\"It allowed us to interrupt and disrupt many of the common exploit kits employed by attackers at the\ntime without waiting for the next Windows release,\" Sutherland said this week. The toolkit also\noffered the company a place to assess the functionality of new security features, he said.\n\nRecently, though, EMET\u2019s usefulness has diminished somewhat, as many of the security controls in the\ntool were integrated into successive Windows versions - most notably, Windows 10.\n\nThe stopgap nature of EMET\u2019s features means that many of them are no longer robust enough to handle\nthe challenges posed by current security exploits, Sutherland said. As a result, multiple, sometimes\ntrivial, exploits are available in the wild currently for bypassing EMET, he noted.\n\nEarlier this year, several security researchers warned of how some exploits from the Angler Exploit\nkit were completely getting around EMET. \"This is something we are seeing for the first time in the\nwild, and we only observed it affecting systems running Windows 7,\" FireEye warned at that time.\n\nThe exploit allowed attackers to install TeslaCrypt ransomware on Windows 7 systems,\u00a0prompting\nconcern about the effectiveness of EMET in stopping such threats.\n\nSutherland noted other problems with EMET as well. Because EMET hooks into low-level areas of\nWindows in a manner not originally intended by developers, it has caused performance and reliability\nproblems for systems running it. \"And this presents an ongoing problem for customers since every OS\nor application update can trigger performance and reliability issues,\" due to compatibility issues,\nhe said.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n", "polarity": 0.10091189674523006, "subjectivity": 0.4870931537598202, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-father-of-sdl-named-to-top-post-at-safecode/d/d-id/1327612", "date": "2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Kelly Sheridan", "title": "Microsoft 'Father Of SDL' Named To Top Post At SAFECode", "body": "The Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode) has a new executive director with\ntoday's appointment of Steve Lipner, former chairman of the organization and former partner director\nof software security at Microsoft.\n\nSAFECode was founded in 2007 by tech companies including Microsoft, Symantec, SAP AG, Juniper\nNetworks, and EMC, with the goal of identifying and sharing best practices for building more secure\nhardware, software, and services.\n\nLipner is assuming leadership of the nonprofit after four decades in software security assurance.\nDuring his time at Microsoft, he led corporate supply chain security strategies and policies for\ngovernment evaluation of Microsoft's security portfolio. He's known as the \"father of SDL\" at\nMicrosoft.\n\n\"I was responsible for getting the security development lifecycle [SDL] created and accepted as a\nmandatory practice across the company,\" he explains, noting this was his largest contribution to the\ncompany.\n\n\"It basically changed what we did for customers in terms of enabling them to look to us and say they\nunderstood we were committed to security, and they were seeing the effects of that,\" he continues.\n\"That was a significant change for customer security and as far as I'm concerned, it's the biggest\nimpact I had in my career.\"\n\nIn his new role, Lipner will help companies develop open frameworks for evaluating software security\nand deliver free in-house training. While there has been progress made in establishing software\nsecurity best practices, more needs to be done so all businesses adopt them.\n\n\"One of the things I learned in 2016 is that although we have a lot of effective practices for\nsoftware security, they are still not universally applied,\" he says. \"It's important for\norganizations to apply secure development practices consistently and broadly.\"\n\nLipner cites SAFECode's Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development\u00a0an early effort to\nshare best practices. The document discusses topics like safe cryptography practices and the\nimportance of threat modeling and analysis. New information is added as new technologies become\nimportant over time; the most recent update was issued in 2014.\n\nThis type of effort is critical at a time when most organizations can anticipate they'll be affected\nby a security breach.\n\nIn 1999-2000, when Lipner started at Microsoft, vulnerabilities were being discovered and reported\nbut not routinely exploited. A few years later, there was less reporting of vulnerabilities and more\nmalicious exploit code, which has contributed to a rise in attacks.\n\nAs cybercrime continued to grow, businesses adopted more secure software development practices.\nHowever, adoption has not been universal. Most people are unaware the software they're writing is\nsecurity critical until an attack takes place.\n\n\"Perfection is hard, but you can certainly raise the bar and make attackers look somewhere else,\"\nLipner notes. In 2017, he anticipates a mix of old and new security threats from the Internet of\nThings, phishing, and website attacks via SQL injection, a topic addressed in the aforementioned\nbest practices document.\n\n\"There are organizations targeted by sophisticated attacks, but a lot are targeted by things it's\npossible to mitigate with best practices and paying attention,\" he explains.\n\nFor example, businesses must not only build secure software, but deploy it as well, to fully protect\ntheir data from attackers. If they don't adhere to administrative basics and set access control\nrights and manage user privilege, their oversight can have bad consequences.\n\nLipner officially begins his new position on Dec. 1. Current executive director Howard Schmidt, who\nled SAFECode for three years, will transition into a new role as executive director emeritus.\n\n\"What I want to do is what I can to help SAFECode do a more effective job at developing and sharing\nsecure practices appropriate to the evolving security environment and technologies, and share those\nwith the community,\" he says of his goals.\n\n", "polarity": 0.26718029238521046, "subjectivity": 0.4814056844794551, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/microsoft-to-block-flash-in-edge-browser-for-security-speed/d/d-id/1327737", "date": "2016-12-16T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Kelly Sheridan", "title": "Microsoft To Block Flash In Edge Browser For Security, Speed", "body": "Microsoft will block Adobe Flash by default in its Edge browser in an effort to help users drive\nperformance, prolong battery life, and strengthen security.\n\nThis marks the next step in a gradual transition away from Flash.

Initiatives have driven\nprogress in identity protection, data management, and staying ahead of attackers.\n\nNow Microsoft is expanding on its security efforts with updates related to Windows 10, Surface\nhardware, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP), Windows Hello, and Windows Analytics.\n\nSurface is getting extra protection at the hardware layer with Surface Enterprise Management Mode\n(SEMM). This is geared towards heavily regulated industries that need physical protection; for\nexample, the option to disable cameras or microphones in classified areas.\n\nSEMM lets businesses control hardware configuration and OS processes within device firmware.\nConfiguration can be applied to specific times of day, WiFi networks, Ethernet, Bluetooth, app\naccess, and certificates that can be launched via initial deployments or pushed to cloud.\n\n\"In some of the most secure and locked-down environments, customers want to know how software is\ndeployed and whether it's in policy,\" says Rob Lefferts, Microsoft's director of program management\nfor Windows Enterprise and Security.\n\nAdmins must have physical possession of the device, and unique certificate signatures, to make any\nchanges. This Surface security update can be deployed on Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, or Surface\nStudio.\n\nMicrosoft is also broadening device management in Windows 10 by bringing security configurations in\nSecurity Baseline Policies to MDM solutions. Previously, these settings were limited to Group\nPolicy. It's also shipping the MDM Migration Analytics Tool to help report on Group Policy settings\nand configure policies for Windows 10 MDM managed devices.\n\nWDATP, first announced at last year's RSA Conference, is getting a few adjustments. Users will be\nable to add customize detection rules and use \"time travel\" detections to look back through the\nprevious six months of data and find undiscovered attacks.\n\nMicrosoft is also integrating security alerts from across the Windows security stack. Users can view\nmalware reports, state of antivirus, and other advanced threats in one place.\n\nIn a one-year update following the $1B security investment, Microsoft CVP and CISO Bret Arsenault\nsaid one of his goals was to completely eliminate passwords within the next two years.\n\nIt's getting one step closer with new adjustments to Windows Hello, which is being expanded to all\norganizations with on-prem Active Directory-only environments. Previously, it was only available to\ndevices with Windows 10.\n\n\"We want to make sure as many customers as possible can take advantage of new security features,\"\nsays Lefferts of the news.\n\nWindows Hello is also being updated with Dynamic Lock, which automatically locks down a device when\nthe user walks away. Bluetooth signals determine the distance between the user's mobile phone and\nWindows 10 device, and can help block unauthorized device access.\n\nMicrosoft is working with Intel on an initiative called Project EVO, which will integrate Windows\nHello with Intel's Authentice tech. The idea is to bring the hardware-based authentication of\nIntel's tool to protect Hello users from more advanced threats.\n\nOn the analytics front, Microsoft is broadening its Windows Analytics portfolio to include Update\nCompliance. The idea behind this is to give a broad view of Windows 10 update compliance for both\nmonthly and feature updates. Businesses can use it to watch deployment progress, pinpoint problems,\nand maintain a broader view of their patched environment.\n\nUpdate Compliance will be free; it's in public preview starting today.\n\nFinally, Microsoft is announcing that the National Security Agency (NSA) is adding Surface devices\n(Pro 3, Pro 4, and Surface Book) to its list of Commercial Solutions for Classified Programs (CSfC).\n\n\"The cybersecurity landscape is in a situation of ever-increasing threats,\" says Lefferts. \"As the\nworld becomes more connected, the opportunities keep coming up for bad guys to do bag things, and\nprofit from it.\"\n\n", "polarity": 0.09322728775853778, "subjectivity": 0.39276958573833576, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/microsoft-fixed-windows-vulns-before-shadow-brokers-dump/d/d-id/1328643", "date": "2017-04-17T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Kelly Sheridan", "title": "Microsoft Fixed Windows Vulns Before Shadow Brokers Dump", "body": "Microsoft claims it addressed Windows exploits, released last week in a Shadow Brokers dump, in\npatches ahead of the leak.\n\nLast Friday the Shadow Brokers released a series of Windows exploits allegedly belonging to the\nNational Security Agency (NSA).

At the time of the leak, many\nreports suggested Windows operating systems could be vulnerable to attack.\n\nIn a blog post published April 14, Microsoft reports it looked into the exploits disclosed by Shadow\nBrokers and discovered most of them had already been addressed in March updates.\n\n\"Customers have expressed concerns around the risk this disclosure potentially creates,\" wrote\nPhillip Misner of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). \"Our engineers have investigated\nthe disclosed exploits, and most of the exploits are already patched.\"\n\nThe three exploits not addressed in the patch cannot be reproduced on supported systems, meaning\nusers running Windows 7 and above, or Exchange 2010 and above, are not at risk.

The vulnerability already had been weaponized in attacks to\ndistribute the Dridex banking Trojan, as a botnet payload, and in a cyber espionage campaign.\n\nSecurity firm McAfee published a report on April 7 to warn users of an exploit that has been used to\ntarget users since late January. SophosLabs claims attacks actually date back to November 2016, with\nmost occuring between March and April 2017.\n\nThere are a few reasons this bug is especially dangerous: it affects most, or all, Windows versions\nof Microsoft Word, and targets don't have to enable macros for exploits to be effective, explains\nBryan Burns, vice president of threat research and engineering at Proofpoint.\n\nBurns says it's a logic bug, which is harder to defend against, he says. Victims are more likely to\nfall for these attacks because they aren't prompted to enable macros -- something businesses teach\ntheir employees to avoid. Instead, the attacks use a dialogue box.\n\n\"They've probably been trained over the last several years not to enable macros,\" says Burns. \"This\nis a different vector. Users haven't seen a dialogue box. They haven't been trained not to click on\nit.\"\n\nThe attackers attach emails containing Microsoft Word RTF (Rich Text Format) documents. Subject\nlines read \"Scan Data\" and attachments were named \"Scan_123456.doc\" or \"Scan_123456.pdf\" with\n\"123456\" replaced with random numbers, Proofpoint reports.\n\nWhen launched, the exploit connects to a remote server, downloads a file containing HTML application\ncontent, and executes it as a .hta file, McAfee explains. Because .hta is executable, the attacker\ngains full code execution on the machine. After the malware has been installed, the exploit closes\nthe bait Word document and displays a new one to show the victim.\n\nThe exploit uses an embedded OLE2link object in specially created documents.\n\n\"Everything is working as designed,\" says Burns of how the attack deceives targets. \"But the way\nit's designed, it left a corner open so code can run when you wouldn't expect it to be running.\"\n\nIn the case of Dridex, attackers obtained full system control to launch the banking Trojan malware.\nThis enabled them to grab businesses' financial credentials and intercept transactions to steal\nmoney. \"In this case, it was financially motivated,\" says Burns of the attackers' goals. \"They were\ntrying to infect with this malware to empty out [organizations'] bank accounts.\"\n\nBut Burns warns that this Office flaw would allow for any type of malware to be installed.\nRansomware is one example Proofpoint sees frequently distributed.\n\n\"We would expect any threat actor who is trying to attack businesses to try this technique,\" he\ncautions.\n\nSeveral security firms aside from Proofpoint observed this vulnerability in the wild ahead of\nMicrosoft's patch. Netskope's Threat Research Labs linked this zero-day to the Godzilla botnet\nloader. Researchers saw IPs released to the botnet loader serving payloads related to exploits for\nthe vulnerability using malicious Word documents.\n\nIn a different scenario, FireEye spotted this flaw being used in a cyber espionage campaign\ntargeting Russian-speaking victims since January 2017 and installing FINSPY, a tool previously\nassociated with the \"lawful intercept\" company Gamma Group. FireEye in another case saw exploits\ninstalling Latentbot, a malware family used by cybercriminals for financial gain.\n\nNow that Microsoft has issued a fix, businesses should protect themselves by patching as quickly as\npossible, Burns says. He also cautions organizations to be wary of these types of attacks, as email\nas the \"dominant threat vector\" hackers will use to infect businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, today is the last day of extended support for Windows Vista.

In its security bulletin summary for April 2012, Microsoft says\nit expects miscreants to quickly develop reliable exploits capable of leveraging at least four of\nthe vulnerabilities.\n\nAmong those is an interesting weakness (MS12-024) in the way that Windows handles signed portable\nexecutable (PE) files. According to Symantec, this flaw is interesting because it lets attackers\nmodify signed PE files undetected.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the attacker doesn\u2019t need to worry about controlling memory; once the user runs the\ncontent, the device has been infected,\u201d wrote John Harrison, group product manager for Symantec\nSecurity Response. \u201cThe most common attack will probably be a scenario in which a site offers a free\ndownload of a specific program that appears to be legitimately signed.\u201d\n\nWolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer for vulnerability management firm Qualys, is particularly\nworried about MS12-027, because the weakness spans an unusually wide range of Microsoft products.\nMicrosoft agrees, calling this patch the highest priority security update this month.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this bulletin stand out is that Microsoft is aware of attacks in the wild against it and\nit affects an unsually wide-range of Microsoft products, including Office 2003 through 2010 on\nWindows, SQL Server 2000 through 2008 R2, BizTalk Server 2002, Commerce Server 2002 through 2009 R2,\nVisual FoxPro 8 and Visual Basic 6 Runtime,\u201d Kandek said. \u201cAttackers have been embedding the exploit\nfor the underlying vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) into an RTF document and enticing the target into\nopening the file, most commonly by attaching it to an e-mail. Another possible vector is through web\nbrowsing, but the component can potentially be attacked through any of the mentioned applications.\u201d\n\nOther notable fixes from Microsoft this month include a .NET update, and a patch for at least five\nInternet Explorer flaws.

The company\nalso was granted permission to take control of 800 domains that were used by the crime machines.The\ncompany published a video showing a portion of the seizures, conducted late last week with the help\nof U.S. Marshals.\n\nThis is the latest in a string of botnet takedowns executed by Microsoft\u2019s legal team, but it\nappears to be the first one in which the company invoked the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations (RICO) Act.\n\n\u201cThe RICO Act is often associated with cases against organized crime; the same is true in applying\nthe civil section of the law to this case against what we believe is an organization of people\nbehind the Zeus family of botnets,\u201d wrote Richard Boscovich, senior attorney for Microsoft\u2019s Digital\nCrimes Unit. \u201cBy incorporating the use of the RICO Act, we were able to pursue a consolidated civil\ncase against everyone associated with the Zeus criminal operation, even if those involved in the\n\u201corganization\u201d were not necessarily part of the core enterprise.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say how much of an impact this effort will have, or whether it will last long.\nPrevious takedowns by Microsoft \u2014 such as its targeting of the Kelihos botnet last fall \u2014 have\nproduced mixed results. There also are indications that this takedown may have impacted legitimate \u2014\nalbeit hacked \u2014 sites that crooks were using in their botnet operations. According to data recorded\nby Abuse.ch, a Swiss security site that tracks ZeuS and SpyEye control servers, some of the domains\nMicrosoft seized appear to belong to legitimate businesses whose sites were compromised and used to\nhost components of the malware infrastructure. Among them is a site in Italy that sells iPhone\ncases, a Thai social networking forum, and a site in San Diego that teaches dance lessons.\n\nThe effort also shines a spotlight on an elusive group of cyber thieves operating out of Ukraine who\nhave been tagged as the brains behind a great deal of the ebanking losses over the past five years,\nincluding the authors of ZeuS (Slavik/Monstr) and SpyEye (Harderman/Gribodemon), both identities\nthat were outed on this blog more than 18 months ago.

Perhaps I\u2019m becoming a curmudgeon,\nbut I\u2019m growing weary of the incessant update prompts from Firefox. It seems that almost every time\nI start it up it\u2019s asking to restart the browser or to remove plugins that no longer work with the\nlatest version. I\u2019ve been gradually transitioning more of my work over to Google Chrome, which seems\nfaster and updates the browser and any installed plugins silently (and frequently patches oft-\ntargeted plugins like Flash Player even before Adobe officially releases the update).\n\n", "polarity": 0.1083011583011583, "subjectivity": 0.5306842556842557, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/microsoft-issues-stopgap-fix-for-duqu-flaw/", "date": "2011-11-04T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft Issues Stopgap Fix for \u2018Duqu\u2019 Flaw", "body": "Microsoft has released an advisory and a stopgap fix for the zero-day vulnerability exploited by the\n\u201cDuqu\u201d Trojan, a highly targeted malware strain that some security experts say could be the most\nimportant cyber espionage threat since Stuxnet.\n\nAccording to the advisory, the critical vulnerability resides in most supported versions of Windows,\nincluding Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7. The problem stems from the way Windows parses certain\nfont types. Microsoft says it is aware of targeted attacks exploiting this flaw, but that it\nbelieves few users have been affected.\n\nNevertheless, the flaw is a dangerous one. Microsoft said that an attacker who successfully\nexploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code, install programs; view, change, or delete\ndata; or create new accounts with full user rights. The most likely vehicle for the exploit is a\npoisoned email attachment.\n\nMicrosoft is working on developing an official security update to fix the flaw. For now, it has\nreleased a point-and-click Fixit tool that allows Windows users to disable the vulnerable component.\nEnabling this tweak may cause fonts in some applications to display improperly.

Richard Boscovich, senior attorney for\nMicrosoft\u2019s digital crimes unit, said that although spam from Rustock-infected PCs has ceased, there\nare still hundreds of thousands of infected computers around the world to be cleaned of the botnet\nmalware.\n\n\u201cThis reward offer stems from Microsoft\u2019s recognition that the Rustock botnet is responsible for a\nnumber of criminal activities and serves to underscore our commitment to tracking down those behind\nit,\u201d Boscovich wrote in a post on the official Microsoft blog. \u201cWhile the primary goal for our legal\nand technical operation has been to stop and disrupt the threat that Rustock has posed for everyone\naffected by it, we also believe the Rustock bot-herders should be held accountable for their\nactions.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft recently ran advertisements in major newspapers in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as part of a\ndeal the company struck with a U.S. court to help dismantle Rustock; the court granted Microsoft\ndominion over the Rustock control servers and domains as long as the company made a \u201cgood faith\u201d\neffort to notify the unidentified owners.\n\nThis is the fourth reward of $250,000 that Microsoft has offered in its anti-virus reward program.\nIt has paid a reward only once: For information leading to the arrest and conviction of the author\nof the Sasser worm. The person who provided the tip in that case was a classmate of the Sasser worm\nauthor.\n\nThe catch with Microsoft\u2019s offer is that they are soliciting offers of \u201cnew\u201d information on the\nRustock author(s). My own follow-the-money sleuthing on the individual who paid for the hosting that\nsupported the Rustock control servers traced back to a very specific person \u2014 a Russian man that\nMicrosoft later named in its public filings with the court.

The sole critical patch from this month\u2019s batch addresses an unusual Bluetooth\nvulnerability that could let nearby attackers break into vulnerable systems even when the targeted\ncomputer is not connected to a network.\n\nBluetooth is a wireless communications standard that allows electronic devices \u2014 such as laptops,\nmobile phones and headsets \u2014 to communicate over short distances (the average range is between 30 to\n100 meters, but that range can be extended with specialized tools). To share data, two Bluetooth-\nenabled devices normally need to \u201cpair\u201d with one another, a process that involves the exchange of a\npasskey between the two devices.\n\nBut Microsoft today shipped a patch to fix a flaw in its Bluetooth implementation on Windows Vista\nand Windows 7 computers that it said attackers could use to seize control over a vulnerable system\nwithout any action on the part of the user.\u00a0 The assailant\u2019s computer would need to be within a\nshort distance of the victim\u2019s PC, and the target would merely need to have Bluetooth turned on.\nJoshua Talbot, security intelligence manager for Symantec Security Response, said the vulnerability\ncould be exploited without any alerts being sent to the victim PC.\n\n\u201cAn attacker would exploit this by sending specific malicious data to the targeted computer while\nestablishing a Bluetooth connection,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cBecause of a memory corruption issue at the\nheart of this vulnerability, the attacker would then gain access to the computer. All this would\nhappen before any notification alerts the targeted user that another computer has requested a\nBluetooth connection.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is unlikely, such a vulnerability could be used to power a computer worm that spreads\nfrom one Bluetooth-enabled Windows laptop to another, Talbot said.\n\nMicrosoft advisory states: \u201cWindows Vista and Windows 7 support a wide range of Bluetooth radio\ndevices, and will install the Bluetooth driver when a removable Bluetooth device is added to the\nsystem. As a result, all supported versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7 are affected.\u201d\n\nBut Talbot added that many Windows laptops are configured to make connectivity as easy as possible\nfor users, and will turn on Bluetooth when the computer\u2019s wireless Internet component is active or\nsearching for networks (which, for many machines, is all the time).\n\nMicrosoft fixed 21 other security vulnerabilities this Patch Tuesday; all of them were less severe,\nso-called \u201cprivilege escalation\u201d flaws that are of little use unless the attacker already has a\nfoothold on the target\u2019s system.\n\nUpdates are available from Windows Update, or via Automatic Updates.

Two of them fix critical vulnerabilities in\nthe \u201cserver message block\u201d or SMB service, which handles Windows networking. Attackers could exploit\nthe flaw addressed by MS11-020 by sending a single, specially crafted evil data packet to a targeted\nsystem. This is the type of flaw that should concern any network administrator, because it has high\npotential to be used to power an automated computer worm.\n\nMicrosoft also called attention to MS11-018, which is a cumulative security update for Internet\nExplorer that fixes critical flaws in all versions of the browser except the latest IE9, which is\nnot affected. One of the IE vulnerabilities \u2014 the MHTML flaw I wrote about in January \u2014 is currently\nbeing exploited; another was discovered at the Pwn2Own hacking competition earlier this year.\n\nMost XP users will find that a total of 22 to 30 patches will be installed, and more if Office 2010\nis installed.\u00a0 The PC will be very busy after reboot and will need about four to five minutes to\ncatch up and finish finalizing all the patches.\u00a0 Included in this month\u2019s patch batch is a .NET\nFramework update, which usually takes a while to download and install.\n\nIn addition to the security updates, Microsoft released two security related tools. The Rootkit\nEvasion Prevention Tool \u201cwill expose an installed rootkit and give your anti-malware software the\nability to detect and remove the rootkit,\u201d wrote Dustin Childs, a senior security program manager at\nMicrosoft. \u201cFor a rootkit to be successful it must stay hidden and persistent on a system. One way\nwe have seen rootkits hide themselves on 64-bit systems is bypassing driver signing checks done by\nwinload.exe.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft expanded the applicability of its Office File Validation tool, a security feature the\ncompany initially released in December 2010 for Office 2010 that has now been extended to work with\nOffice 2003 and 2007. \u201cThis feature, which is included in Word, Excel, PowerPoint and  Publisher\n(.doc, .xls, .ppt and .pub file formats), will validate the  file structure as it is being opened by\nthe user,\u201d wrote Modesto Estrada, Microsoft\u2019s Office Program Manager.

A second update fixes a security issue in the Windows backup tool that\naffects Windows Vista machines.\n\nThe vulnerability in the Windows backup tool stems from a weakness that extends to hundreds of\nthird-party, non-Microsoft applications built to run on Windows.

Some Microsoft\nusers have been spinning conspiracy theories about this patch because it lacks any real description\nof its function, and what little documentation there is about it says that it cannot be removed once\ninstalled and that it may be required as a prerequisite for installing future updates.\n\nNormally, when Microsoft offers a patch through Windows Update, it also will publish a corresponding\n\u201cknowledgebase\u201d article that describes in great detail what the patch does and why users should\ninstall it \u2014 and how applying the update may impact current and future operations on the system.\n\nThis fix went out via Windows Update on Oct. 26 as a \u201crecommended\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d patch, but it\nlacked any additional details, prompting conspiracy theories and speculation on message boards from\nusers wondering whether they should ignore or install this update \u2014 which for many users was\nsandwiched between the dozens of security patches Microsoft began offering earlier this month as\npart of its regular Patch Tuesday security update cycle.\n\nTo make matters worse, many Windows 7 users said the patch was no longer offered after they declined\ninstalling it the first time, leading some curious researchers to dub it the \u201cBlackhole\u201d update.\n\nI have verified with Microsoft that this update is designed to smooth the way for the deployment of\nfuture updates on Windows 7 systems (read on to the very end if you\u2019d like the official response\nfrom Microsoft). The confusion appears to stem from a timing mistake by the folks at Microsoft, but\nthis incident illustrates the hysteria that can ensue when the world\u2019s largest software company\nfails \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 to be fully transparent with a user base that has come to expect\ndetailed advisories with every patch.\n\nWhen I was researching this patch, I found an amusing thread on the Microsoft Answers forum \u2014 where\nseveral Microsoft most valuable professional experts urged other forum members to hold off\ninstalling the patch until more information was available. Others offered more speculative answers,\nsuggesting that the patch was instead:\n\n-A new service pack for Windows 7\n\n-A \u201cheuristic scanner to the machine that turned on whenever the machine went idle, and searched all\nattached storage devices for \u2018terrorism-related\u2019 information, then alerting \u2018somebody\u2019 over the\nInternet\u201d\n\n-The result of Microsoft having been hacked, with the patch being some kind of malicious third-party\ncode being sent out to infect all Windows machines\n\n-A new anti-piracy check from Microsoft.\n\nHere is the official response I just received from Microsoft about this update:\n\nBottom line: It should be safe to install this relatively harmless update, which is designed in part\nto help pave the way for Service Pack 1, the first major bundle of fixes and stability updates for\nMicrosoft\u2019s flagship operating system. However, SP1 isn\u2019t due out for a while yet, so it\u2019s also safe\nto delay installing this update for a bit.

That story got picked up by BoingBoing, Gizmodo, NPR\nand a variety of other sites, public attention that no doubt played a part in the near-immediate\nsuspension of that criminal Web site.\n\nAt first, it wasn\u2019t clear what was behind the attack, which at one point caused a flood of traffic\naveraging 2.3 gigabits of junk data per second (see graph above). Not long after the attack ended, I\nheard from Raymond Dijkxhoorn and Jeff Chan, co-founders of SURBL, which maintains a list of Web\nsites that have appeared in spam. Chan sent me a message saying he had tracked the attack back to\nseveral Internet addresses, including at least one that appeared to be located on Microsoft\u2019s\nnetwork \u2014 131.107.202.197.\n\nAccording to SURBL, the culprits were botnets under the thumb of \u201cthe usual Russian pill gangs\u201d:\nDozens of domains that resolve(d) to online pharmacy sites \u2014 including bridgetthefidget.com,\ncrazygraze.com, firstgang.com, triplefixes.com and philsgangdirect.com \u2014 were using a compromised\nmachine at that Microsoft address as a domain name server.\n\nThe attackers then told machines they controlled to access a number of non-existent pages at sites\nthat were pointing to the Internet address my hosting provider has assigned to KrebsOnSecurity.com\n(94.228.133.16). This forced several hundred or thousand machines to direct their traffic at my\nsite, all in an attempt to prevent legitimate visitors from visiting it.\n\nFor example, the attack packets included DNS for false requests such as:\n\nmzkzalczdznzjzfbszvzazd.jumpgirlsaloud.nl A     94.228.133.163\n\nsdfsdfsdfsdfsdffbszvzazd.youralveolarbone.nl A  94.228.133.163\n\nzzncmzkzalczdznzjzfbszvzazd.cheapxenonbulbs.com         A 94.228.133.163\n\nzzncmzkzalczdznzjzfbszvzazd.expletivedirect.com         A 94.228.133.163\n\nI found the unusual method of attack interesting because it called attention to a significant amount\nof infrastructure used by the bad guys. For all I know, this may have been intentional, either to\nlet me know who was responsible, or to make me think I knew who was responsible.\n\nIn any case, the attack took place in the early morning U.S. time, and by the time I\u2019d woken up that\nday, my hosting provider, Dijkxhoorn\u2019s Prolocation.net, had already dealt with the attack handily.\nChan said SURBL had alerted Microsoft regarding the compromised IPs, and I filed the information\naway for a future blog post but for a variety of reasons forgot about it. Until Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s when I read a story in The Register by tech reporter Dan Goodin, who wrote that for the past\nthree weeks, Internet addresses belonging to Microsoft had been used to route traffic to more than\n1,000 fraudulent pharmacy Web sites maintained by a notorious group of Russian criminals responsible\nfor promoting Canadian Health&Care Mall pill sites. That story jogged my memory because it\nhighlighted the very same Microsoft IP address that was implicated in the attack on my site.\n\nRonald F. Guilmette,\u00a0 the security researcher who shared that information with The Register, told\nKrebsOnSecurity that the pharmacy domains referenced in Goodin\u2019s story appeared to be tied to an\nICANN-accredited domain registrar in Turkey named Alantron. Although the pill site domain names that\nwere associated with the Microsoft server are registered through a variety of non-Alantron\nregistrars, all of them appear to use DNS servers tied to Alantron\u2019s domain.\n\nFor example, bafereuti.com, lixduoxbe.com and others as of late Tuesday used yok15.alantron.com, and\ndozens of other pill sites associated with this gang use similar Alantron DNS entries, all the way\nup to yok87.alantron.com, yok88.alantron.com, and yok89.alantron.com. A complete list is available\nhere.\n\nAlantron did not respond to requests for comment. Again, the Alantron connection could be just\nwillful misdirection on the part of the pill pushers. Still, the company has a history of abuse and\nneglect issues. In April, ICANN warned Alantron that it was in breach of its registrar accreditation\nagreement with ICANN because it failed to provide a WHOIS server to allow visitors to look up the\nownership information of domains registered through its service. A copy of that ICANN order is\navailable here (PDF).\n\nGuilmette said that since The Register story ran, Microsoft appears to have addressed the\ncompromised system on its network. Redmond did not respond to requests for comment about the\ncompromised server; no doubt, most of their botnet experts are tied up at Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes\nConsortium, an anti-botnet conference going on this week up in\u2026well Canada, naturally.\n\nIn just one of the many ironies in this story, the compromised server inside of Microsoft appears to\nhave been running Linux, not one of Microsoft\u2019s server technologies. According to Guilmette, all of\nthe hacked servers used by this pill gang are Unix or Linux servers. This mode of operation matches\nthat of \u201cBulker.biz,\u201d a rogue pharmacy affiliate program known for promoting rogue \u201cCanadian\nHealth&Care Mall\u201d pill sites \u2014 as well as a number of other brands \u2014 by hijacking poorly-secured\nLinux and Unix servers.\n\nUpdate, 7:34 p.m. ET: Christopher Budd, Microsoft\u2019s response manager for trustworthy computing, sent\nthis statement via email: \u201cMicrosoft became aware of reports on Tuesday, October 12, 2010, of a\ndevice on the Microsoft network that was possibly compromised and facilitating spam attacks. Upon\nhearing these reports, we immediately launched an investigation. We have completed our investigation\nand found that two misconfigured network hardware devices in a testing lab were compromised due to\nhuman error.

Then, about a week ago, experts began charting where in the world\nmost victims were based. According to Symantec, roughly 60 percent of the systems infected with this\nfamily of malware were based in Iran, while computers in Indonesia and India also were hard-hit.\n\nOne equally likely scenario that I haven\u2019t heard suggested much yet is that perhaps we are seeing\nevidence of our country\u2019s own cyber warriors probing the networks of other nations. It is notable\nthat the first definitions that the major anti-virus firms shipped for the Stuxnet malware were\nissued on or around the same day as my story, and that this malware was first discovered one month\nearlier by VirusBlokada, a relatively tiny anti-virus firm in Belarus that said it found the worm on\ncomputers belonging to one of its Iranian customers. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s unlikely that a malware\nthreat initially directed at Iran would show up on the radar of U.S.-based anti-virus makers, all of\nwhom are prohibited by U.S. trade sanctions from selling products and services to Iran.\n\n", "polarity": 0.10274231865695281, "subjectivity": 0.44681818181818184, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/microsoft-security-updates-and-a-farewell-to-windows-xp-service-pack-2/", "date": "2010-07-13T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft Security Updates, and a Farewell to Windows XP Service Pack 2", "body": "Microsoft today released software updates to fix at least five security vulnerabilities in computers\nrunning its Windows operating system and Office applications.

Microsoft issued two\n\u201ccritical\u201d patches that address one security flaw apiece, while Adobe\u2019s patches fix a whole mess of\nserious vulnerabilities in its software.\n\nOne of the critical updates pushed by Microsoft fixes a flaw in Outlook Express, Windows Mail and\nWindows Live Mail. On older versions of Windows (Windows XP for example) Outlook Express  is\ninstalled by default, while Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail  generally require users to\naffirmatively download and install the  program.\n\nThe other MS patch addresses a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, but the problem may turn out to be\nmore complex down the road for some users. The trouble is that the vulnerable component, Microsoft\nVisual Basic for Applications is used not only by Microsoft Office products, but it\u2019s also a\ncomponent that is potentially installed by many third-party software apps built to work with\nWindows.\n\n\u201cLike the ATL issue last July, we could see many vendors supplying their own patches to address this\nvulnerability,\u201d said Jason Miller, data and security team manager for Shavlik Technologies. \u201cThis is\njust another important reminder that patching is not just a Microsoft issue  when it comes to\nsoftware vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nAs always, the Microsoft patches are available through Windows Update or by enabling Automatic\nUpdate.\n\nAdobe issued patches to fix security problems in its Cold Fusion and Shockwave Player software\npackages. Most end users will only have to worry about the Shockwave update, if that. The Shockwave\npatch fixes at least 18 security vulnerabilities in the commonly-installed media player application,\non both Windows and Mac systems. Adobe has assigned the bugs an aggregate \u201ccritical\u201d rating, meaning\nthat an attacker who successfully exploited the flaws could seize control over an affected system.\n\nHere\u2019s a way to test whether you even have Shockwave Player on your  system: Visit this page.  If it\nsays you need to install a missing plugin, then you don\u2019t have  Shockwave Player installed, and you\nprobably don\u2019t need it. I haven\u2019t had it on my main PC since I bought the thing more than a year\nago, and apparently I haven\u2019t missed it.\n\nIf that link above shows that you do have Shockwave Player installed,  it\u2019s time to update it. The\nflaws are in Shockwave Player version 11.5.6.606 and earlier. Adobe recommends that Shockwave users\nactually  uninstall the program (Windows users can do this via the Add/Remove  Programs menu), and\nthen reboot before attempting to install the latest,  patched version, v.\u00a0 11.5.7.609, available\nhere.\n\n", "polarity": 0.10163833456516382, "subjectivity": 0.5198509485094851, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/04/adobe-microsoft-push-security-upgrades/", "date": "2010-04-13T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Adobe, Microsoft Push Security Upgrades", "body": "Software giants Adobe and Microsoft today each released software updates to fix critical security\nflaws in their products.

Among those is a patch for all versions of Windows that fixes a bug which\ncould allow attackers to fool Windows into thinking that a malicious program was created by a\nlegitimate software vendor, said Joshua Talbot, security intelligence manager, Symantec Security\nResponse.\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability allows an attacker to force Windows to report to the user that the application\nwas created by any vendor the attacker chooses to impersonate,\u201d Talbot said.\n\nAnother patch fixes a flaw that is critical on Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003 and Server 2008, and\ncould be triggered just by visiting a Web page hosting a specially-crafted .avi video file.

The software giant orchestrated a legal sneak attack against the Web servers\ncontrolling the Waledac botnet, a major distributor of junk e-mail. In an unrelated and more\ncontroversial move, Redmond convinced an ISP to shutter a popular whistleblower Web site for hosting\na Microsoft surveillance compliance document.\n\nOn Feb. 22, a federal judge in Virginia granted a request quietly filed by Microsoft to disconnect\n277 Internet domains believed to be responsible for directing the daily activities of the Waledac\nbotnet, estimated to be one of the ten-largest spam botnets in existence today and responsible for\nsending 1.5 billion junk e-mails per day. Microsoft said it found that between December 3-21, 2009,\napproximately 651 million spam emails attributable to Waledac were directed to Hotmail accounts\nalone, including offers and scams related to online pharmacies, imitation goods, jobs, penny stocks\nand more.\n\nThe takedown, which Microsoft dubbed \u201cOperation b49,\u201d has \u201cquickly and effectively cut off traffic\nto Waledac at the \u2018.com\u2019 or domain registry level, severing the connection between the command and\ncontrol centers of the botnet and most of its thousands of zombie computers around the world,\u201d the\ncompany said. From the official Microsoft blog:\n\nWhat praise and adulation the IT industry might heap on Microsoft for this effort, however, may be\ndrowned out by the growing chorus of criticism over Microsoft\u2019s legal victory against a popular\nwhistleblower Web site. Alleging copyright infringement, Microsoft went after Cryptome.org curator\nJohn Young on Tuesday after he posted a Microsoft compliance document that the company gives to law\nenforcement agents seeking information on Microsoft users.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cryptome was shut down by its hosting provider, Network Solutions. As wired.com\u2019s Ryan\nSingel writes, the takedown shuttered \u201ca site that thumbed its nose at the government since 1996 \u2014\nposting thousands of documents that the feds would prefer never saw the light of day.\u201d\n\nPredictably, the document has since shown up on numerous other Web sites, including Wikileaks.org,\nand Wired.com. It includes information about the various types of customer information available to\nlaw enforcement across Microsoft\u2019s properties, such as Xbox Live. The document, titled \u201cGlobal\nCriminal Compliance Handbook,\u201d is worth a read for anyone curious about the types of identifying\nuser information that Microsoft may make available to law enforcement upon request\n\n\u201cOn the botnet stuff, Microsoft deserves credit for its strategy and the court deserves kudos for\nunderstanding the importance of the case,\u201d former Justice Department prosecutor Mark Rasch said.\n\u201cThe other takedown, though, is unwinable for Microsoft, because it\u2019s a little like wrestling with a\npig: You\u2019re just going to make the pig mad.\u201d\n\nUpdate, 1:19 p.m. ET: ReadWriteWeb is reporting that Microsoft has decided to withdraw the copyright\ncomplaint against Cryptome, and that the site is expected to be back online today.\n\n", "polarity": 0.09346240179573514, "subjectivity": 0.456604938271605, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/02/microsoft-got-bluescreen-check-for-rootkits/", "date": "2010-02-18T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft: Got Bluescreen?

Today, Microsoft rejected the latter possibility, and said it had\nconcluded that the reboot occurs because the system is infected with malware, specifically the\nAlureon Rootkit.\n\n\u201cWe were able to reach this conclusion after the comprehensive analysis of memory dumps obtained\nfrom multiple customer machines and extensive testing against third party applications and\nsoftware,\u201d wrote Mike Reavey, director of the Microsoft Security Response Center. \u201cThe restarts are\nthe result of modifications the Alureon rootkit makes to Windows Kernel binaries, which places these\nsystems in an unstable state.\u00a0 In every investigated incident, we have not found quality issues with\nsecurity update MS10-015.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as I noted in a post earlier this week, Alureon is among the Top 10 threats that Microsoft\u2019s\nvarious security technologies \u2014 including its \u201cmalicious software removal tool\u201d \u2014 regularly detect\non Windows systems. According Microsoft\u2019s own Security Intelligence Report, Microsoft\u2019s security\nproducts removed nearly 2 million instances of Alureon from Windows systems in the first half of\n2009 alone, up from a half million in the latter half of 2008. [Microsoft\u2019s malicious software\nremoval tool is a download offered through automatic update and Windows update that runs in the\nbackground once a month, and removes any malware it finds.]\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s guidance for people who have been affected by this leaves a bit to be desired. The\ncompany says users should continue to deploy this month\u2019s security updates and make sure their\nsystems are up-to-date with the latest anti-virus software. Microsoft also says it is working on a\nsimpler solution to detect and remove Alureon from affected systems which should be released in a\nfew weeks, as are several other third party vendors.\n\nObviously, if you are having trouble getting out of the reboot loop caused by this patch+infection,\nyou are not going to be able scan your system with a traditional anti-virus program. I have posted\ninstructions here on how to manually remove both the problematic patch and the infected system\nfiles. But folks who have recovered their systems through these methods should strongly consider\nscanning their systems for additional malware with several anti-virus tools. I list a few free\nonline scanners at this blog post, but be aware most of those require users to install ActiveX\ncontrols and to use Internet Explorer.\n\nIf you want to be doubly sure, I would suggest booting your computer into a Live CD solution that is\ncentered around removing virus infections, such as the AVAST!

In all, nine Microsoft\nproducts received updates totaling 45 unique CVEs. \n\nThree of the vulnerabilities among Tuesday\u2019s updates, according to Microsoft, are under active\nattack. \n\nOne of the bugs (CVE-2017-0199) under attack is the zero-day vulnerability that used an embedded\nOLE2link object in a specially-crafted document to spread the Dridex banking Trojan. \u201cThere are\nupdates for both Office and Windows to be applied, and both should be considered necessary for\ncomplete protection,\u201d according to a Patch Tuesday analysis by the Zero Day Initiative. \n\nMicrosoft also pushed out a patch for an Internet Explorer elevation of privilege vulnerability\n(CVE-2017-0210) that was being actively exploited in attacks. This vulnerability could allow an\nattacker to access information from one domain and inject it into another domain, according to\nMicrosoft. \n\nAn advisory was issued for (CVE-2017-2605) a Microsoft Office bug in the Encapsulated PostScript\n(EPS) filter in Office. Microsoft did not issue an update for this vulnerability. However, it\nreleased an update for Microsoft Office that turns off, by default, the EPS filter in Office as a\ndefense-in-depth measure, according to Microsoft. \n\n\u201cMicrosoft is aware of limited targeted attacks that could leverage an unpatched vulnerability in\nthe EPS filter and is taking this action to help reduce customer risk until the security update is\nreleased,\u201d Microsoft noted. \n\nMicrosoft also issued a fix for its new version of Windows 10 (Creators Update), which was made\ngenerally available today. It addresses several remote code execution and elevation of privilege\nvulnerabilities, said Greg Wiseman, senior security researcher with Rapid7. \n\n\u201cData center admins can\u2019t rest easy, however. This month sees updates for all supported versions of\nWindows Server, with fixes across the board for RCE, privilege escalation and denial of service\nvulnerabilities,\u201d Wiseman said. \n\nIn all, 13 critical updates were part of this month\u2019s list of vulnerabilities. Microsoft IE and Edge\nbrowsers received the majority of the critical updates. \n\nOne of the IE vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0201) is a RCE bug that exists in the way that the JScript\nand VBScript engines render when handling objects in memory in IE 9 and 10. \u201cAn attacker who\nsuccessfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user,\u201d\nMicrosoft wrote. \n\nMicrosoft issued a fix for a scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2017-0093)\nimpacting Edge. In the most common scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that\nis designed to exploit the vulnerability in Edge. \u201cThe vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a\nway that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user,\u201d Microsoft\nwrote. \n\n\u201cAlso listed as critical are three CVEs for Hyper-V, which was an untested target in the most recent\nPwn2Own,\u201d noted Zero Day Initiative. Pwn2Own is the hacking competition held alongside CanSecWest\nthat took place last month in Vancouver. The vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0162, CVE-2017-0163,\nCVE-2017-0180) could allow malicious guest applications to execute code on the Hyper-V host\noperating system. \n\nBy comparison, today Adobe patched 59 vulnerabilities across Flash, Reader and Photoshop. \n\nToday also marked a change in the way Microsoft releases bulletins, moving from the MSxx-xxx format\nand replacing it with a new security update guide. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s new system allows users to pivot on\nthe common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and KB article numbers.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability\ncould elevate privileges in affected versions of Microsoft Edge,\u201d according to Microsoft. \n\nA\u00a0denial of service vulnerability rated important by Microsoft was also patched in\u00a0MS17-004 in the\nLocal Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). The flaw impacts Microsoft Windows Vista,\nWindows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 (and Server Core). The\nvulnerability\u00a0exists in the way the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) handles\nauthentication requests, said Microsoft. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability\ncould cause a denial of service on the target system\u2019s LSASS service, which triggers an automatic\nreboot of the system,\u201d Microsoft said. \n\nFinally, Microsoft also published a critical bulletin, MS17-003,\u00a0tied to a swath of bugs found in\nAdobe Flash Player used in its Windows 8.1 OS (64-bit, 32-bit), Windows RT 8.1, multiple versions of\nWindows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Those Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities were outlined earlier\nTuesday by Adobe when it announced a bevy of patches that addressed code execution flaws in Flash,\nReader and Acrobat. Besides applying the requisite patches, Microsoft suggested disabling instances\nof Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer and other applications that honor the kill bit feature,\nsuch as Office 2007 and Office 2010. \n\nToday\u2019s\u00a0Patch Tuesday, the first of 2017, marks the first monthly cycle that Microsoft is doing away\nwith bulletins for newer products. Instead, Microsoft patches will be delivered in one installable\npackage.

According to researchers, the attacks were effective at bypassing most mitigation efforts. \n\nThe patch was part of Microsoft\u2019s scheduled Patch Tuesday software updates. \n\n\u201cThis is the first campaign we have observed that leverages the newly disclosed Microsoft zero-day,\u201d\nProofpoint wrote in a technical analysis of the zero day. \u201cThis represents a significant level of\nagility and innovation for Dridex actors.\u201d \n\nThe Microsoft zero-day vulnerability, according to Proofpoint, was extremely effective. \u201cWhen\nrecipients open the document, the exploit\u2013if successful\u2013is used to carry out a series of actions\nthat lead to the installation of Dridex botnet ID 7500 on the user\u2019s system,\u201d researchers wrote. \n\n\u201cThe Microsoft OLE2Link object can open application data based on the server-provided MIME type,\nwhich can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable\nsystem,\u201d according an\u00a0advisory released by the DHS-sponsored CERT hosted at the Software Engineering\nInstitute at Carnegie Mellon University. \n\nThe zero-day, first reported by McAfee on Friday, is notable because in most cases macro-laden\ndocuments attached to emails are blocked by mitigations built into Office and Microsoft\u2019s Windows\n10. In this case, users also do not have to enable macros for the exploit\u00a0to execute. \n\nIn a test by Proofpoint, a system was exploited just by opening an Office 2010 document. As the\ndocument opened, users were presented with a dialogue box that asked \u201cThis document contains links\nthat may refer to other files. Do you want to update this document with the data from the linked\nfiles?\u201d \n\n \n\nAccording to Proofpoint, \u201cuser interaction was not required\u201d and once the dialogue box appeared, the\nDridex malware injection process began. \n\nThe attack involves a Microsoft Office RTF document that contain an embedded OLE2link object. \u201cWhen\nthe user opens the document, winword.exe issues a HTTP request to a remote server to retrieve a\nmalicious .hta file, which appears as a fake RTF file,\u201d according to an analysis of the zero day by\nFireEye researchers. \n\nThe HTA application then loads and executes malicious scripts that halt the winword.exe loading\nprocess. Next, the scripts download payloads and load a decoy document for the user to see,\naccording to FireEye. \n\n\u201cThe original winword.exe process is terminated in order to hide a user prompt generated by the\nOLE2link,\u201d FireEye researcher wrote. \n\n\u201cClearly the fact that the RTF file is able download the malicious HTML that enables local execution\nof malware points to a lack of control in interpreting untrusted input from the outside world,\u201d said\nPaul Farrington, manager of EMEA Solution Architects at Veracode. \u201cThe Microsoft engineers will not\nonly need to devise a patch for this vulnerability, but also to remodel their threat assessment of\nthis type of file interaction,\u201d Farrington said. \n\nThe spam campaigns delivering the zero day spoofed the recipient\u2019s domain in the sender\u2019s email\naddress and appear to be from either \u201ccopier\u201d, \u201cdocuments\u201d, \u201cnoreply\u201d, \u201cno-reply\u201d, or \u201cscanner\u201d.

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the\nScStoragePathFromUrl function in the WebDAV service in IIS, version 6.0.

According to the company\u00a0the vulnerability (CVE-2017-0005)\naffects mostly older versions of Windows and can allow an adversary to execute remote code if a user\neither visits a specially crafted website or opens a rigged document. \n\nThe vulnerability, outlined Monday in a technical paper by Microsoft, affects the Windows Win32k\ncomponent in the Windows GDI (Graphics Device Interface). If exploited it\u00a0could potentially allow an\nadversary to launch an elevation of privilege attack. \n\n\u201cAttackers are not as much focusing on legacy systems but avoiding security enhancements present in\nmodern hardware and current platforms like Windows 10 Anniversary Update,\u201d according to Matt Oh, a\nmember of Microsoft\u2019s Windows Defender ATP Research Team, who authored the report. \n\nThe GDI library vulnerability was patched on March 14 with\u00a0MS17-013. At the time, Microsoft did not\ndisclose the vulnerability was being actively exploited however. The bug discloses data through\nmemory and was revealed by Google\u2019s engineer Mateusz Jurczyk. Microsoft originally patched the\nvulnerability (CVE-2017-0038) in June 2016 classifying it as important. But in February, Google\u2019s\nProject Zero security researchers discovered the fix was incomplete. \n\nAfter skipping February\u2019s round of Patch Tuesday updates, the company has released additional\ninsights into the vulnerability. \n\nA technical breakdown of the exploit by Microsoft revealed the zero-day EoP exploit targets\ncomputers running Windows 7 and Windows 8. According to researchers, there are four execution stages\nof the exploit package and corresponding functions. \n\nStage 1 is decrypting\u00a0the initial main exploit code\u2019s PE file using AES-256 algorithm. A hard-coded\npassword is used as a key to decrypt the loader for the next stage. State 2 includes the API\nresolution routine, resembling, as Microsoft notes, how shellcode or position-independent code\nworks. State 3 includes determining the identity of the operating system platform and version\nnumber. \n\nThe actual exploit routine comprises stage 4. \n\n\u201cAfter the environmental checks, the attacker code begins actual exploit of the Windows kernel\nvulnerability CVE-2017-0005, resulting in arbitrary memory corruption and privileged code\nexecution,\u201d Oh wrote. \n\nInteresting to researchers, is the code execution used by Zirconium is made possible by a corrupted\npointer in the PALETTE.pfnGetNearestFromPalentry function, which is designed to execute code in the\nkernel courtesy of a malformed PALETTE object. This, according to Oh, is an exploitation technique\nMicrosoft security researchers have been tracking closely for years. \n\n\u201cObserved in an unrelated sample used during the Duqu incident, we have described this relatively\nold exploit technique in a Virus Bulletin 2015 presentation,\u201d Oh wrote. Duqu attackers were believed\nto be behind attacks against certificate authorities and spy campaigns on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \n\nMicrosoft said, while the use of a malformed PALETTE object ties Duqu and Zirconium exploits\ntogether, however the way they take advantage of the vulnerability is different. \n\n\u201cThis difference clearly indicates that these two exploits are unrelated, despite similarities in\ntheir code\u2014similarities that can be attributed to the fact that these exploitation techniques are\nwell-documented,\u201d Oh said. \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s the corrupted pointer in the PALETTE.pfnGetNearestFromPalentry function that Microsoft\nhas based mitigation around\u00a0CVE-2017-0005 on. In August 2016, with the Windows 10 Anniversary\nUpdate, Microsoft released tactical mitigations designed to prevent the abuse of\npfnGetNearestFromPalentry,\u00a0the company claims. \n\nOn the flip side of tactical mitigation are strategic mitigation efforts that include Supervisor\nMode Execution Prevention (SMEP), supported by newer model Intel CPUs, and virtualization-based\nsecurity (VBS). \n\n\u201cStrategic mitigation like SMEP can effectively raise the bar for a large pool of attackers by\ninstantly rendering hundreds of EoP exploits ineffective, including old-school exploitation methods\nthat call user-mode shellcode directly from the kernel, such as the zero-day exploit for\nCVE-2017-0005,\u201d Oh wrote. \n\nIn some instances, Microsoft acknowledges, that sophisticated attackers have been able to work\naround SMEP protections. \n\n\u201cThese bypass mechanisms include the use of kernel ROP gadgets or direct PTE modifications through\nread-write (RW) primitives,\u201d he said. \n\nTo address these bypass mechanisms Microsoft said it made improvements to\u00a0Windows kernel 64-bit\nmemory-protection process ASLR it introduced with Windows 10 Anniversary Update. ASLR coupled with\nthe OS makes SMEP stronger via randomized kernel addresses, mitigating a bypass vector resulting\nfrom direct PTE corruption, the company said. \n\n\u201cWhile patches continue to provide single-point fixes for specific vulnerabilities, this attacker\nbehavior highlights how built-in exploit mitigations like SMEP, the ASLR improvements, and\nvirtualization-based security are providing resiliency,\u201d Oh said. \n\nOh claims\u00a0Microsoft is continuing to actively research Zirconium, the APT group it identified as\nactively exploiting the CVE-2017-0005 vulnerability. \n\n", "polarity": 0.10447120708748613, "subjectivity": 0.4794573643410852, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/malware-that-targets-both-microsoft-apple-operating-systems-found/124531/", "date": "2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Malware That Targets Both Microsoft, Apple Operating Systems Found", "body": "Researchers came across a malicious Word document last week that doesn\u2019t discriminate between OS\nplatforms. The malicious Word document is designed to spread malware on either Mac OS X or Microsoft\nWindows, depending on where it\u2019s opened. \n\nLike many other strains of malware these days, the sample, which researchers at Fortinet observed\u00a0on\nMarch 16, relies on tricking users into enabling macros. \n\nOnce opened and macros are enabled, malicious VBA, or Visual Basic for Applications, code is\nexecuted, which runs the AutoOpen() macro. The macro goes on to read a base64-encoded string in the\nfile, which depending on the operating system, executes a certain script. \n\nFor victims running Mac OS X, the script, is fairly straightforward. It downloads a malicious file\ncontaining another script, written in python, that\u2019s executed and attempts to communicate with the\nattacker\u2019s server.\u00a0The downloaded script is a modded version of a Python meterpreter file,\nresearchers say. \n\nMeterpreter, part of the Metasploit framework, is extensible payload component that uses in-memory\nDLL injection stagers.\u00a0The tool has been adopted by several groups of late, including GCMAN and a\ngroup of attackers who have been spotted carrying out\u00a0fileless malware-based attacks. \n\nThe script that triggers the exploit on Windows is a little more involved. Like a Russian nesting\ndoll, one layer of base64-encoded data spawns a powershell script, which decompresses another layer\nof base-64-encoded code which leads to another powershell script. Once executed, the script finally\ndownloads a 64-bit DLL file, which executes and communicates with the attacker\u2019s server. Researchers\nwith Fortinet believe the Windows side of the malware only affects 64-bit versions of Windows. \n\nWhile they have a pretty good idea of how the malware spreads, researchers\u00a0aren\u2019t completely sure\nwhat the attackers behind it were after. Peixue Li, senior manager of FortiGuard Service Development\nand Security Research told Threatpost Thursday that when they observed TCP sessions to the\nattacker\u2019s server \u2013 both Windows and Apple \u2013 the server\u00a0wasn\u2019t answering. Instead, Wireshark just\ngave them a TCP retransmission error message. \n\nMacro malware that explicitly targets macOS isn\u2019t necessarily new \u2013 but it has been a recent\ndevelopment. Researchers with Synack came across macro malware that executes solely on Mac machines\nback in February. \n\nThat malware, peddled by a group whose IP traces back to Russia, operated in a similar fashion. The\nvictim would have to agree to enable macros for a Word document on the Mac version of Word. After\nenabled, a macro decodes data, and like the malware Fortinet researchers found, executes it in\nPython. The malware Synack found relies on leveraging a legitimate python post-exploitation OS X and\nLinux agent, EmPyre. \n\nFortinet\u2019s researchers claim they\u2019re still analyzing the malware, but Li says\u00a0the fact that the\nmalware\u2019s Python post-exploitation agent is different than the one used by the malware seen by\nSynack separates it from a pack. \n\n\u201cThe malware we analyzed targets both Mac OS and Windows\u2026 the Python post-exploitation agent used by\nthe malware is different. One is EmPyre, the other is Meterpreter, Li said, \u201cCross-platform Macro-\nbased malware could become a trend, perhaps.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.07270923520923521, "subjectivity": 0.42709368820479937, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/intel-microsoft-announce-new-bug-bounties/124354/", "date": "2017-03-15T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Intel, Microsoft Announce New Bug Bounties", "body": "Intel announced its first bug bounty program, offering up to $30,000 to researchers who find\ncritical vulnerabilities in its hardware. \n\nThe invite-only program, which is being\u00a0run on the HackerOne platform, was announced today at the\nCanSecWest conference in Vancouver. \n\nIntel said its software, firmware and hardware are in scope for rewards, with critical software and\nfirmware finds being worth $7,500 and $10,000 respectively. \n\n\u201cWe want to encourage researchers to identify issues and bring them to us directly so that we can\ntake prompt steps to evaluate and correct them, and we want to recognize researchers for the work\nthat they put in when researching a vulnerability,\u201d Intel said. \u201cBy partnering constructively with\nthe security research community, we believe we will be better able to protect our customers.\u201d \n\nIntel announced further pricing for its bounty: up to $10,000 for high-severity hardware bugs, up to\n$2,000 for medium-severity issues and up to $1,000 for low severity. \n\nHigh-severity firmware bugs could be worth up to $5,000 while high-severity software flaws could\nfetch up to $2,500. \n\nIntel said that its Intel Security products, the former McAfee, are not in scope for a bounty, nor\nare Intel\u2019s web infrastructure, or recent acquisitions. \n\nMicrosoft also announced today that it was launching a bug bounty for its Office Insider Builds on\nWindows. \n\nInsider Builds, Microsoft said, provides users with early access to new Office capabilities and\nsecurity features.

Another flaw in the\nSMB file-sharing protocol was also publicly disclosed after it was discovered the original patch\nreleased last year for the bug was incomplete. The Department of Homeland Security released an\nadvisory upon disclosure of the SMB bug, a memory corruption issue which could crash Windows\nsystems. \n\nThe worry expressed by a number of experts centered on the time users were exposed and the public\navailability of proof-of-concept code accelerating in-the-wild attacks. \n\n\u201cWhile there may not be active campaigns to exploit these issues today, the clock does appear to be\nticking,\u201d\u00a0said Tod Beardsley, senior research director at Rapid7 in a Feb. 23 interview with\nThreatpost. \n\nAmong today\u2019s 18 security bulletins, eight were rated critical, including separate bulletins for\nEdge and IE that patched the two Google-disclosed bugs. MS17-006 patches 12 vulnerabilities in IE,\nincluding CVE-2017-0037\u2014which is also patched in Edge\u2014disclosed by researcher Ivan Fratric, who\nprivately disclosed the flaw to Microsoft last Friday and expressed surprise the company was not\nable to patch it sooner. The flaw is a type-confusion bug in Edge for Windows 10 and in IE 11 that\nallows for arbitrary code execution. \n\nMicrosoft said four other bugs addressed in the IE bulletin were also publicly disclosed, a\nprivilege escalation flaw (CVE-2017-0154), an information disclosure bug (CVE-2017-0008) and two\nbrowser spoofing vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0012 and CVE-2017-0033). \n\nThe Edge bulletin, meanwhile, patched 32 vulnerabilities, with four of the same bugs patched in the\nIE bulletin. Eighteen memory corruption vulnerabilities were patched in the Edge scripting engine\nalone, while three browser spoofing issues were publicly disclosed (CVE-2017-0012 and CVE-2017-0033\nas in IE, and CVE-2017-0069). The Edge bulletin patches remote code execution, elevation of\nprivilege, information disclosure and security feature bypass vulnerabilities. \n\nThe disclosed Windows GDI library vulnerability (CVE-2017-0038) was patched in MS17-013; the bug\ndiscloses data through memory and was disclosed by Google engineer Mateusz Jurczyk. Microsoft\noriginally patched this issue in June 2016, but the fix was incomplete. The GDI bulletin patches 20\nCVEs overall. \n\nIn Jurczyk\u2019s proof-of-concept exploit,\u00a0multiple bugs related to the handling of DIBs (Device\nIndependent Bitmaps) embedded in EMF (Enhanced Metafile Format) records created conditions where\n\u201c255 pixels are drawn based on junk heap data, which may include sensitive information, such as\nprivate user data or information about the virtual address space,\u201d the researcher said. \n\nThe SMB vulnerability, meanwhile, was patched in MS17-012, one of six vulnerabilities addressed in\nthe bulletin. The denial-of-service vulnerability was privately disclosed Feb. 2 by researcher\nLaurent Gaffie, who found the flaw in SMB 2.0 and 3.0. \n\n\u201cThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain requests sent by a malicious SMB server to\nthe client,\u201d Microsoft said in the advisory. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploited this\nvulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding until it is manually restarted.\u201d \n\nIn addition to Gaffie\u2019s original proof-of-concept exploit, other researchers quickly found ways to\nuse it in attacks. \n\nGaffi\u00e9\u2019s proof of concept relies on tricking a victim to connect to a malicious SMB server instance,\nsomething that could prove challenging for an attacker. Experts with Dell SecureWorks said that it\ncould be more effective for attackers to combine Gaffi\u00e9\u2019s attack with a redirect to SMB\nvulnerability from 2015 to crash a victim\u2019s machine. \n\nThere are four other bulletins available today rated critical: \n\nMS17-008: Microsoft also patched Hyper-V, the native hypervisor running on Windows that can create\nvirtual machines, addressing 11 vulnerabilities, including four that could allow for code execution,\nalong with a handful of information disclosure and denial-of-service bugs. \n\nMS17-009: Microsoft patched a remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows PDF Library. The\nmemory corruption issue allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the underlying system; on\nWindows 10 with Edge as the default browser, an attacker could exploit the flaw by tricking a user\ninto visiting a website hosting attack code. \n\nMS17-010: Microsoft patched a half-dozen flaws in the Windows SMB Server, five of allow for remote\ncode execution because of the way the server handles certain requests. A malicious packet sent to a\nSMBv1 server could trigger the vulnerability. The bulletin also addresses a separate information\ndisclosure issue. \n\nMS17-011: Microsoft patched 29 vulnerabilities in Uniscribe, a Windows service used to render\nUnicode.

In a technical report of the bug, Fratric said he was\nsurprised that Microsoft wasn\u2019t able to patch the vulnerability from the time it was privately\ndisclosed. \n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect this one to miss the deadline,\u201d he wrote. \n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft announced it would skip its regular Patch Tuesday release of security\nbulletins and patches.

However, despite the elapse of 90\ndays, Fratric said some details were withheld. \u201cI will not make any further comments on\nexploitability, at least not until the bug is fixed. The report has too much info on that as it is,\u201d\nhe wrote. \n\nProject Zero also reported the vulnerability, based on how the browsers handle data within the\ncontext rax, can be used to crash the browser and impact uninitialized memory. \n\n\u201cThe crash occurs because rax points to uninitialized memory,\u201d wrote Fratric. \u201cAn attacker can\naffect rax by modifying table properties such as border-spacing and the width of the firs TH\nelement,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy hypothesis, given that there are 2 types of columns in DOM: html table\ncolumns and CSS columns, is that IE/Edge gets confused between the two.\u201d \n\nIn lieu of a patch from Microsoft, mitigation is limited, noted Fratric. \u201cAdding a type check\nsomewhere in the vulnerable function might be sufficient, but it also might be just fixing the\nsymptom and not the root cause,\u201d he noted in his research notes. \n\nWhen asked last week, Microsoft declined to explain why it skipped its February Patch Tuesday\nrelease. \u201cThis month, we discovered a last minute issue that could impact some customers and was not\nresolved in time for our planned updates today,\u201d it explained in a blog post to TechNet. \n\nAt the time, Tod Beardsley, senior research director at Rapid7, told Threatpost he could not recall\na time when Microsoft has had fixes announced for publicly demonstrable issues, and then failed to\nrelease them. \n\n\u201cWhile there may not be active campaigns to exploit these issues today, the clock does appear to be\nticking,\u201d he told Threatpost last week. \n\nMicrosoft has addressed some vulnerabilities, despite skipping Patch Tuesday this month.

In a proof-of-concept\nexploit,\u00a0multiple bugs related to the handling of DIBs (Device Independent Bitmaps) embedded in EMF\n(Enhanced Metafile Format) records created conditions where \u201c255 pixels are drawn based on junk heap\ndata, which may include sensitive information, such as private user data or information about the\nvirtual address space.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is possible to disclose uninitialised or out-of-bounds heap bytes via pixel colors, in Internet\nExplorer and other GDI clients which allow the extraction of displayed image data back to the\nattacker,\u201d Jurczyk said. \u201cI have confirmed that the vulnerability reproduces both locally in\nInternet Explorer, and remotely in Office Online, via a .docx document containing the specially\ncrafted EMF file.\u201d \n\nGoogle Project Zero, the internet giant\u2019s bug hunting team, privately disclosed the vulnerability to\nMicrosoft on Nov. 16. As part of Project Zero\u2019s policy, it will notify parties of a vulnerability\nand after 90 days elapses the vulnerabilities become public \u2013 whether or not they have been patched\nby the company in question. \n\nMicrosoft did not reply to requests for comment. \n\nMicrosoft originally issued a patch classified as \u201cimportant\u201d in June to address the vulnerability.\nAt the time, Microsoft described it as a bug that could allow elevation of privilege if a user opens\na specially crafted document or visits a specially crafted website. \n\nAccording to MITRE\u2019s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure database, the flaw (CVE-2017-0038) is a\nresult of \u201can incomplete fix for CVE-2016-3216, CVE-2016-3219, and/or CVE-2016-3220.\u201d \u00a0According to\nthe CVE ID, impacted are Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7\nSP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10 Gold, 1511, and 1607,\nand Windows Server 2016. \n\n\u201cIt is strongly advised to perform a careful audit of all EMF record handlers responsible for\ndealing with DIBs, in order to make sure that each of them correctly enforces all four conditions\nnecessary to prevent invalid memory access (and subsequent memory disclosure) while processing the\nbitmaps,\u201d Jurczyk wrote. \n\n", "polarity": 0.09945302445302447, "subjectivity": 0.4816173316173316, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-waits-for-patch-tuesday-to-fix-smb-zero-day/123541/", "date": "2017-02-03T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Waits for Patch Tuesday to Fix SMB Zero Day", "body": "Microsoft will not rush out an emergency patch for a zero-day vulnerability disclosed on Wednesday\nin the Windows implementation of the Server Message Block protocol. \n\nResearcher Laurent Gaffie announced in a tweet, below, that he\u2019d found a zero-day vulnerability in\nSMBv3 and released a proof-of-concept exploit.

The next scheduled Microsoft update is Feb. 14. \n\nGaffie said the vulnerability is specifically a null pointer dereference in SMB and that it affects\nWindows Server 2012 and 2016. He added that a joint analysis between himself and Microsoft concluded\nthat code execution doesn\u2019t seem possible through an exploit of this vulnerability. SMB is generally\nnot exposed to the Internet, though Gaffie said that outbound connections where clients connect to\nremote file servers are more likely to be allowed than inbound SMB connections over an open port\n445. \n\n\u201cThis bug can be used to trigger a reboot on a given target, it can be either local (via netbios,\nllmnr poisoning) or remote via a UNC link (example: adding an image with a link:\n\\\\attacker.com\\file.jpg in an email),\u201d Gaffie said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that this trivial bug\nshould have been caught immediately by their SDLC process, but surprisingly it was not. \u201cThis means\nthat the new code base was simply not audited or fuzzed before shipping it on their latest operating\nsystems.\u201d \n\nGaffie also said he decided to release details prior to the availability of a patch because it\u2019s not\nhis first experience working with Microsoft where they have delayed a patch release for one of his\nbugs. \n\n\u201cI decided to release this bug\u00a0one\u00a0week\u00a0before\u00a0the patch is released, because it is\u00a0not the first\ntime Microsoft sits on my bugs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing free work here with them (I\u2019m not paid in\nanyways for that)\u00a0with the\u00a0goal of helping their users.

The PoC\nwould require an attacker to send a link to a victim, luring them to connect to a malicious SMB\nserver instance. \n\n\u201cA URL like \\\\[server ip address\\IPC$\u00a0would trigger the exploit,\u201d Ullrich said. \u201cI have tested it in\nEdge and Internet Explorer on Windows 10 with a local html file like that and it shut down the\nsystem immediately. \n\n\u201cThe exploit implements its own SMB server, so it is as easy as running the exploit, making sure the\nuser can connect (e.g. firewall issues) and then sending the \u2018right\u2019 link to the user,\u201d Ullrich\nsaid. \u201cThis is pretty easy to exploit. Took me maybe 10 minutes to get it to work. The exploit comes\nwithout instructions.\u201d \n\nUllrich explained that the attacker will respond with a crafted Tree Connect Response\u2014Tree Connect\nRequests are sent to Windows Servers when users connect to shares\u2014that is lengthy and also includes\na \u201clong trailer.\u201d He explained in the SANS ISC post that the tree connect response message consists\nof a NetBIOS header and message type of a total length of 1580 bytes, and a SMB2 header that is 64\nbytes long. The Tree Connect Response message has a fixed length of 8 bytes in addition to the fixed\nheader. \n\n\u201cThis is where the message should end. But apparently, since the total message size according to the\nNetBIOS header is larger, Windows keeps on decoding in the crafted header (all \u2018C\u2019s\u2019 in the\nexploit), which then triggers the buffer overflow,\u201d Ullrich said. \n\n", "polarity": 0.08612946507683349, "subjectivity": 0.49432229563808505, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-publicly-disclosed-ie-edge-vulnerabilities/122453/", "date": "2016-12-13T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches Publicly Disclosed IE, Edge Vulnerabilities", "body": "Microsoft today patched a half-dozen critical browser vulnerabilities that have been publicly\ndisclosed, but apparently not used in attacks as of yet. \n\nThe critical Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge bulletins are among six released today, along with\nsix others with a severity rating of important. Today\u2019s patches cap off a year in which there was a\n15 percent increase in the number of Microsoft security bulletins, according to research from\nQualys. \n\n\u201cOut of more than 3 billion scans that Qualys performs each year we saw an increase of about 20% in\nthe total number of Microsoft vulnerabilities,\u201d said Amol Sarwate, director of Qualys Vulnerability\nLabs. \n\nThe Edge bulletin, MS16-145, patches 11 vulnerabilities, most of which are remote code execution\nvulnerabilities. The three publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, however, are two information\ndisclosure bugs (CVE-2016-7206 and CVE-2016-7282) and a security feature bypass (CVE-2016-7281). The\nsecurity feature bypass exists because of the way the browser applies the Same Origin Policy for\nscripts running inside Web Workers, Microsoft said. The Same Origin Policy prevents browsers from\nrunning scripts and accessing content that doesn\u2019t originate from the same site. \n\nThe Edge bulletin also patches seven memory corruption vulnerabilities that lead to remote code\nexecution; two are in the browser and five are in Microsoft scripting engines. \n\nThe IE bulletin, MS16-144, also includes fixes for four vulnerabilities also patched in Microsoft\nEdge; eight flaws are patched in total. Two of the three publicly disclosed Edge bugs were also\nfound in IE, while the third publicly available bug, CVE-2016-7202, is a memory corruption\nvulnerability in the scripting engine. Microsoft said none of the available bugs have been used in\nattacks. \n\nThe remaining critical bulletins start with MS16-146, an update for the Microsoft Graphics\nComponent. It includes patches for two remote code execution vulnerabilities and an information\ndisclosure bug in Windows GDI that can be exploited online or by convincing a victim to open a\ndocument containing the exploit. MS16-147 takes care of a single remote code execution flaw in\nMicrosoft Uniscribe, Windows services that render Unicode text. MS16-148, meanwhile, is a critical\nOffice bulletin that patches 16 vulnerabilities. The flaws put Office users at risk for remote code\nexecution; the bulletin patches information disclosure, security feature bypass, memory corruption\nand elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. \n\nTwo kernel updates, both rated important in severity, also merit some attention. MS16-150 patches a\nprivilege escalation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to violate Virtual Trust Levels, an\nisolation and exploit mitigation feature. Microsoft said Windows Secure Kernel Mode fails to handle\nobjects in memory properly, and a local attacker could run a crafted application on a targeted\nsystem to exploit the flaw. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasingly using software defined controls like virtualization for segmentation and\nisolation of workloads, applications, and data,\u201d said Bobby Kuzma, Core Security systems engineer.\n\u201cAs these capabilities become a core aspect of the operating systems architecture, it deserves\nincreased scrutiny of research into bypasses for those mitigations.\u201d \n\nMS16-152 patches a kernel level information disclosure vulnerability which is triggered because of\nthe way the Windows kernel handles certain page fault system calls. A local attacker would need to\nbe authenticated to carry out this attack, but could force the vulnerable system to disclose\ninformation from one process to another, Microsoft said. \n\n\u201cRemote code execution exploits require information on the relative location of different constructs\nin memory. Technologies that randomize that layout serve to make the attackers job harder. A\nsuccessful modern RCE requires two vulnerabilities: one to leak information on where the parts an\nattacker needs to overwrite, and a second to do the actual overwrite in memory that leads to the\ncode execution,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cBy closing off a potential information disclosure vulnerability, that\nremoves it from contention for attackers down the road, making for a more hardened attack surface.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft also patched a .NET vulnerability it rates as important in severity that has also been\npublicly disclosed. MS16-155 affects .NET 4.6.2 Framework\u2019s Data Provider for SQL Server.

The vulnerability being targeted was\nprivately disclosed by Turkish security researcher Utku Sen, and was patched by Microsoft this\nmonth. \n\nAccording to\u00a0Sen, the vulnerability took advantage a flaw in Microsoft\u2019s DKIM (DomainKeys Identified\nMail) validator used in Outlook 365, part of Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 Web Services suite. Exploiting\nthis weakness, a hacker could use email forwarding tools in Outlook 365 to validate phishing emails\nthat spoofed the Microsoft.com domain. The technique could give bogus emails the appearance of\nlegitimacy and avoid the messages from getting caught in a recipient\u2019s spam filter. \n\nSen, an application security engineer based in Turkey, said the vulnerability is particularly\nproblematic when used in conjunction with the popular Russian email service from Yandex. That\u2019s\nbecause Yandex email recipients who were on the receiving end of the spoofed emails in question,\nalso received green \u201ccheck\u201d certificates, below, that indicated the emails were authenticated and\ncould be trusted. That green certificate, according to Yandex, indicated: \u201cWith a DKIM signature,\nthe email recipient can verify that the message really came from the supposed sender.\u201d \n\n \n\nMicrosoft and Yandex, considered the Google of Russia, addressed the vulnerability earlier this\nmonth. \n\nIn Sen\u2019s tests, he used the email phishing tool called SEES (Social Engineering Email Sender). SEES\nallows you to craft emails with bogus email sender-field data that could be anything, such as\nMickeyMouse[@]Disney.com, SatyaNadella[@]Microsoft.com or AccountServices[@]Microsoft.com. The catch\nis, most email services such as Yandex, Google and Yahoo normally catch these types of crafted\nphishing emails sent from tools such as SEES and send them straight to a spam folder. \n\nHowever, when Sen configured his Outlook 365 web client to automatically forward spoofed emails to\nGoogle, Yandex or any email address, the spoofed email were identified as valid. \n\nSen theorizes that the culprit was the Microsoft signing domain (onmicrosoft.com) that his Outlook\n365 client was using. He believes that typically emails that spoof sender data are sent straight to\na recipient\u2019s spam filter because emails lack a valid signature and can\u2019t be authenticated. The\nproblem was tied to the way Outlook 365 was handling forwarded email when the spoofed domain was\nMicrosoft[.]com. Outlook 365 automatically validated those spoofed messages and tricked spam filters\ninto thinking emails were legit. \n\nSince Sen posted a technical explanation of the vulnerability, he updated his analysis with a\nplausible explanation from a Reddit user who agreed Microsoft\u2019s DKIM validation process was to\nblame. \n\n\u201cBecause Outlook was blindly signing these messages it was redirecting, if the message had a fake\nfrom field saying\u00a0something@microsoft.com, then after Outlook blindly redirected it, it\u2019d have a\ngenuine DKIM signature from Microsoft by coincidence, even though the original email wasn\u2019t from\nMicrosoft at all,\u201d Sen said. \n\nWhen Sen tried the same technique using email forwarding features in Gmail or Yandex the\nvulnerability wasn\u2019t present. In Sen\u2019s tests, the vulnerability only worked when used through\nOutlook 365. \n\nSen said he identified that problem in September, and by late October Microsoft informed him the\nvulnerability was fixed. Earlier this month, Microsoft Security Response Center\u00a0credited Sen for\nfinding the vulnerability. Yandex has since stopped supporting the green DKIM verification\ncertificate shown on \u201cvalidated\u201d emails, according to Sen. \n\n", "polarity": 0.02595238095238095, "subjectivity": 0.42115646258503403, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-cutting-off-sha-1-support-in-february-for-edge-ie-11/122119/", "date": "2016-11-22T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Microsoft Cutting Off SHA-1 Support in February for Edge, IE 11", "body": "Microsoft confirmed that Feb.\u00a014, 2017 is the cutoff date for SHA-1 support in its Microsoft Edge\nand Internet Explorer 11 browsers.

But the industry has a long way to go to update,\naccording to Venafi. It estimates 35 percent of websites (out of 11 million public websites) are\nstill using SHA-1 certificates. \n\nIn a blog post, Microsoft said that its transition will impact only SHA-1 certificates that chain to\na Microsoft Trusted Root certificate authority. The tech giant also attempted to allay fears over\nthe migration saying manually installed enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be\nimpacted; ensuring a smooth transition for internal corporate sites mostly located behind a\ncompany\u2019s firewall. \n\nMicrosoft also said that system administrators can get a jump on testing SHA-2 readiness if they are\nrunning the November 2016 Windows Updates, including the November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality\nRollups for Windows 7/Windows 8.1. Those users can use Edge and IE 11 to test how their site will be\nimpacted by the SHA-2 migration, Microsoft said. \n\nAdditionally, users that visit sites that have missed the Feb.\u00a014, 2017 migration date will also\nhave the option to ignore the certificate error and will be able to continue to the website in\nquestion. \n\nMicrosoft also clarified concerns around cross-signed certificates explaining that Windows will only\ncheck if the thumbprint of the root certificate is in Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program. \u201cA\ncertificate cross-signed with a Microsoft Trusted Root that chains to an enterprise/self-signed root\nwould not be impacted by the changes planned for February 2017,\u201d according to Alec Oot and Jody\nCloutier both senior program managers at Microsoft. \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s SHA-1 certificate error message to be displayed after Feb. 14, 2017 on Edge and IE 11\nbrowsers. \n\n\u201cCertificate security is critical to a website\u2019s success.

This is particularly critical in\ntransactions that include sensitive data such as ecommerce and online banking,\u201d notes Venafi\u2019s Scott\nCarter in a recent post regarding SHA-1 depreciation. \n\nConsequences to website owners that don\u2019t migrate include visitors being warned of visiting insecure\nwebsites and being urged to look elsewhere for content.

Incidents of encryption-based ransomware\nthat locks up data on a PC has risen five-fold over the past year jumping from 6.6 percent in\n2014/2015 to 31 percent the preceding year. \n\nMicrosoft says it has bolstered Windows 10 to reflect those changing tactics of criminals.

In addition to container management,\nMicrosoft adds new kernel protection to Windows 10 Anniversary Update that limits the ways in which\nsystem calls can be used by Microsoft Edge, according to Microsoft. \n\n\u201cIf a malware author attempts using a vulnerable system call to escape the browser\u2019s sandbox and\ndownload and install ransomware in a way that does not fit within these new restrictions, Microsoft\nEdge will block the system call, preventing the attack,\u201d Microsoft said. \n\nPart of Microsoft\u2019s anti-ransomware security also includes a combination of human and machine\nlearning to protect against malware. On one hand, Microsoft\u00a0 bolsters its Edge browser with its\nSmartScreen Filter (introduced with Internet Explorer 8).\u00a0 It\u2019s SmartScreen Filter roughly competes\nwith Google\u2019s Safe Browsing initiative in that they both use a human and machine-generated URL\nblacklists to block users from visiting unsafe sites. \n\nOver the past six months, Microsoft says it has also been leveraging its machine-learning technology\nand cloud-based automatic sample submission features in Windows Defender to help block ransomware\nfrom inboxes. Using both can block previously unidentified malware, Microsoft says. \u201cDefinition\nupdates can take hours to prepare and deliver; our cloud service delivers this protection in\nseconds,\u201d Microsoft said. \n\nAs part of Windows Anniversary Edition the company introduced Windows Defender Advanced Threat\nProtection (ATP), a new service that gives remote security staff members a shared dashboard to view\nsecurity events and alerts in their network and mitigate remote threats. \n\nDespite ransomware victories, such as CrySis being neutralized via the release of master decryption\nkeys, the threat of ransomware persists with most strains targeting Windows users. In August,\nransomware called Fantom was discovered masquerading as a fake critical Windows update. Last summer,\nshortly after Windows 10 was released, attackers began launching spam and phishing email campaigns\naround the operating system. Victims received messages claiming users could upgrade to Windows 10\nfor free. Those who downloaded the malicious .zip archive were ultimately hit with CTB-Locker\nransomware and had their files encrypted. \n\n", "polarity": 0.10819559228650141, "subjectivity": 0.4682782369146006, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-tears-off-the-band-aid-with-emet/121824/", "date": "2016-11-07T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Tears off the Band-Aid with EMET", "body": "Microsoft last week extended the end-of-life expiration date to July 2018 on its exploit mitigation\nadd-on, the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). But for some time, the once-useful tool\nhas been well on its way out to pasture. \n\nWhile EMET was never meant to be anything more than stopgap protection against exploits, attackers\nand white-hat researchers accelerated its demise with a number of publicized bypass attacks. That\nsituation, plus Microsoft\u2019s urgency to have users migrate to Windows 10 and the array of new memory\nmitigations included in the latest OS has brought the curtain down on EMET. \n\n\u201cIt was a stopgap. It was never supposed to be something [Microsoft] wanted people to use longterm,\u201d\nsaid Cody Pierce, director of vulnerability research at Endgame. \u201cThey want people to upgrade\nWindows 10; for the good of their customers, they want to transition them to Windows 10 where there\nare some protections baked into the operating system.\u201d \n\nForemost is Control Flow Guard, a technology built to counter memory-corruption vulnerabilities,\nwhich has been available since Visual Studio 2015 and is also built into Windows 10 and Windows 8.1.\nControl Flow Guard is thought to be a primary impediment to use-after-free attacks, which became a\nfavorite exploit once ASLR and DEP put a damper in buffer overflow attacks. \n\n\u201cThere are a lot more compile time mitigations [in Windows 10] like Control Flow Guard, and a new\nReturn Flow Guard feature,\u201d said Darren Kemp, security researcher with Duo Security. Kemp also\npointed out that since Windows 10\u2019s mitigations are integrated into the operating system, unlike\nEMET, there are fewer instances where users will notice a performance hit, which was increasingly\ncommon with EMET. Also, EMET required close care when configuring it to work, otherwise it could\nbreak certain application processes. \n\n\u201cSince it\u2019s not integrated, you don\u2019t get the same type of tight coupling,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWith a lot\nof stuff in EMET, you have to test the software you\u2019re applying it to, to make sure the mitigations\ndon\u2019t cause problems. It hooks into functions and injects features. If software does non-standard\nthings, it can cause problems with those apps.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has not had EMET on a consistent upgrade path since version 5.0 dropped in\n2014. This was an abrupt change from the early days when EMET was introduced and exploits were\nunleashed within days of Patch Tuesday releases. In announcing the deadline extension to July 31,\n2018, Microsoft\u2019s Jeffrey Sutherland acknowledged EMET\u2019s limitations against modern advanced\nattacks, its performance and reliability shortcomings, and urged users toward Windows 10, which\nmakes the most of hardware virtualization to sandbox applications and links before they can harm the\noperating system. \n\n\u201cWith the types of threats enterprises face today, we are constantly reminded of this simple truth:\nmodern defense against software vulnerabilities requires a modern platform,\u201d Sutherland said. \n\nThe true value of any mitigation continues to be how well it raises the cost of attacks. Pierce\nillustrated how advanced attackers have blown well past EMET\u2019s menu of mitigations with advanced\nlogic that automates many facets of an attack that its defenses cannot keep up with. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an exploit kit writer and you acquire a zero day or develop an exploit, you have to get\nthe most bang for your buck; and part of that is supporting a wide range of targets. If you\u2019ve got a\nFlash exploit, you want it to work on Firefox, Windows, Linux and more and you have to come up with\nways to make it easier on you,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cA lot of the ways they\u2019ve figured out to do that\nbypasses a lot of these late-hook defenses like EMET. They\u2019re getting more value out of it. The\ntypes of exploit mitigations EMET provides were limited in utility due to the nature of\nexploitation. If you look at an exploit kit from 2010, it looks wildly different than it does now.\u201d \n\nDuo\u2019s Kemp, meanwhile, says Windows 10 is one of the hardest targets to breach today. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the nature of this stuff: raising the bar. If you\u2019re an attacker, do you want to invest a\nlot of time and energy to figure out a way around this, or are you going to go after something\nelse?\u201d Kemp said. \n\n", "polarity": 0.21078643578643583, "subjectivity": 0.45360028860028867, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-extends-malicious-macro-protection-to-office-2013/121618/", "date": "2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Microsoft Extends Malicious Macro Protection to Office 2013", "body": "Microsoft is combating a surge in macro-based malware with a new feature that allows system\nadministrators to configure Office 2013 to block Word, Excel, and PowerPoint macros.

In the enterprise, Microsoft reports, 98 percent of Office-targeted threats still use\nold-school macro-based attacks. \n\n\u201cThe enduring appeal for macro-based malware appears to rely on a victim\u2019s likelihood to enable\nmacros. Previous versions of Office include a warning when opening documents that contain macros,\nbut malware authors have become more resilient in their social engineering tactics, luring users to\nenable macros in good faith and ending up infected,\u201d Microsoft said in May. \n\nSome of those threats have included several new strains of macro attacks including one that\ndistributed Donoff downloader, reported in May by Microsoft\u2019s Malware Protection Center. Other\nmacro-based attacks in the past year have included one targeting Amazon customers with a large Locky\nspear-phishing campaign.

Once on the system, the file sports the same blue castle logo that Microsoft\u2019s Security\nEssentials uses however, which could further deceive users into installing the malware. \n\n \n\nAs soon as the executable file is run, the malware hides the mouse cursor, disables Task Manager and\ndisplays a fake BSoD image. \n\nMicrosoft warns that calling the fake support number could either lead to the installation of\nfurther malware, or the installation of software intended to fix a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.

The error message that Hicurdismos displays mimics the same error message\nthat Windows 8 and 10 displays, something else that may trick users. \n\nMalware purporting to be legitimate Windows software has become a bit of an institution over the\nyears. A strain of ransomware, Fantom, was discovered two months ago masquerading as a fake critical\nWindows update. The malware, based\u00a0on the open source EDA2 ransomware project, encrypted victims\nfiles under the guise of a fake update screen. The ransomware duped users by saying it was\n\u201cconfiguring critical Windows updates\u201d while it displayed a spinning counter that ticked off\npercentage points as it encrypted files. \n\nLast summer, shortly after Windows 10 was released, attackers began launching spam and phishing\nemail campaigns around the operating system. Victims received messages claiming users could upgrade\nto Windows 10 for free. Those who downloaded the malicious .zip archive were ultimately hit with\nCTB-Locker ransomware and had their files encrypted. \n\nThe FTC took aim at shady tech support organizations two years ago, shuttering a\u00a0handful\u00a0of services\nwhich used software to trick users into thinking their computers were broken.

The problem said Tod Beardsley, senior security research manager at\nRapid7, is that the Nine app lacked certificate validation when connecting to a Microsoft Exchange\nserver \u2013 regardless of SSL/TLS trust settings. \n\n\u201cAttackers can pluck names and passwords out of the traffic or snag confidential emails as they pass\nby. Basically it\u2019s game over for victims,\u201d Beardsley said. \n\nAccording to Rapid7, the attacker and victim would have to share the same mobile network to carry\nout the vulnerability. In a likely scenario, an attacker would use a rogue Wi-Fi wireless access\npoint (WAP) configured to capture Nine application traffic to Microsoft Exchange servers.

The technology, announced this week at Microsoft\u2019s 2016 Ignite\nconference in Atlanta, takes a virtualization-based approach to isolating browser-based attacks from\nthe internet. \n\nWindows Defender Application Guard will be exclusive to enterprise versions of Windows 10 and will\nbe available for preview Oct. 1 via the Windows Insiders program, with general availability slated\nfor 2017. \n\nThe virtualization approach to containing malware inside a browser is different from browsers Google\nand Firefox which rely heavily on sandboxing technology to keep malicious websites from launching\nbrowser-based attacks against targeted systems. \n\n\u201cThis level of protection has never been more important, as the majority of attacks start in the\nbrowser,\u201d wrote Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft\u2019s Windows and Devices Group in a\nblog post outlining the technology. \n\nWindows Defender Application Guard works by isolating any site an enterprise administrator hasn\u2019t\nalready whitelisted.

The campaign was suspended in late July Proofpoint said after\na nearly three-year run. \n\nAdGholas stood out also for its use of steganography to conceal its attacks, likely the first time\nthis tactic was used in malvertising campaigns. Researchers said that hidden in JavaScript filtering\ncode used by the campaign was more code that used an API to read a PNG and extract even more\nJavaScript.

He also said that some samples would not execute if certain common\napplications were missing such as Skype, iTunes or Torrent applications, indicating the sample was\nlikely executing inside a virtual machine or sandbox. \n\n\u201cThis vulnerability is a MIME type check used to filter out systems that have certain shell\nextension associations, including .py, .pcap, and .saz,\u201d Kafeine wrote in his report. \u201cIn some\ncases, certain extensions association including .doc, .mkv., .torrent, and .skype are required to\ntrigger the next exploitation step.\u201d \n\nIn the meantime, Kafeine said the effectiveness and stealth of this campaign demonstrates the\nimportance for vigilance in keeping browsers and third-party applications up to date. \n\n\u201cThreat actors are increasingly exploiting non-critical bugs and low-level vulnerabilities that may\nremain unpatched for months or years at a time. In this case, the AdGholas group used such a bug\nspecifically to avoid detection by researcher- and vendor-automated systems and thus stay below the\nradar even while they conducted a massive, long-running\u00a0malvertising operation,\u201d Kafeine wrote. \u201cThe\nbottom line? As much as possible, software vendors need to maintain comprehensive patching regimens,\norganizations and users must rethink patching prioritizations, and researchers need to look for new\navenues to detect malicious activity.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.08169002050581, "subjectivity": 0.5353639781271361, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-47-vulnerabilities-with-september-patch-tuesday/120544/", "date": "2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Microsoft Patches 47 Vulnerabilities with September Patch Tuesday", "body": "Microsoft patched 47 vulnerabilities as part of 14 security bulletins, seven critical, with its\nmonthly Patch Tuesday updates today. \n\nThe company is warning users that if left unpatched, 10 of the issues can lead to remote execution. \n\nThe updates resolve issues in Microsoft Windows, Office, Office Service and Web Apps, Exchange, its\nInternet Explorer and Edge browsers and\u00a0Adobe Flash Player. \n\nAmong the bugs fixed on Tuesday is a 10-year-old vulnerability, CVE-2016-0137, that existed in\nDetours, Microsoft Office\u2019s hooking engine. The bug, disclosed over the summer and discussed in\ndepth at Black Hat, affected a handful antivirus platforms that use code hooking. The vulnerability\nallowed hackers to bypass exploit mitigations present in Windows and those third party applications.\nResearchers at enSilo, who unearthed the bug, disclosed it to Microsoft nine months ago, prior to\nBlack Hat. At the time the researchers warned that hundreds of thousands of users could be affected\nby the vulnerability. \n\nUdi Yavo, enSilo co-founder and CTO stressed Tuesday that despite being\u00a0patched, since the\nvulnerability affects an\u00a0engine embedded in products, patching it\u00a0could be an arduous process. \n\n\u201cIn the enterprise \u2014 with Detours integrated into thousands of products, including Microsoft Office\n\u2014 patching could take up to three weeks, if not longer,\u201d Yavo said, \u201cOn top of that, patching this\nparticular vulnerability is even more complicated because fixing it requires a recompilation of each\nproduct individually.\u201d \n\nThe firm released a tool on Github, Find a Detour, designed to aid security teams in determining\nwhich software may be affected by the bug. \n\nBoth Tuesday\u2019s Internet Explorer and Edge updates, MS16-104 and MS16105 respectively, are\ncumulative. The IE update is rated critical for those still running IE 9 or 11 on Windows machines;\nif exploited, one vulnerability could let an attacker take control of an affected system, assuming a\nuser was logged in with admin rights. \n\nMicrosoft is warning that one vulnerability affecting IE and Edge, CVE-2016-3351, discovered by\nFrench security researcher Kafeine and Brooks Li of Trend Micro, has not been publicly exposed but\nis being exploited in the wild. \n\nAccording to a post published Tuesday afternoon by Kafeine on Proofpoint\u2019s blog, the zero day was\nbeing exploited by AdGholas, a group who used steganography to carry out a recent malvertising\ncampaign, and\u00a0GooNky, another group. \n\nThe Edge update, also marked critical, also fixes additional vulnerability that could allow an\nattacker to gain the same rights as the current user. \n\nThree critical vulnerabilities in Exchange Server, MS16-108, scared Bobby Kuzma, CISSP, Systems\nEngineer at Core Security, so much, he said Tuesday he cringed when he read them. The bugs could\nallow remote code execution in Oracle Outside In libraries built into the mail-calendaring server.\nAn attacker could exploit the issue by sending a specially crafted attachment, like a meeting\ninvitation request, to a victim. The issue affects Exchange 2007, 2010, 2013, and the most recent\niteration, 2016. \n\nMS16-106, another critical update, affects a graphics component in Windows, GDI, and builds on a\npatch from last month, MS16-098, and a patch from last year, MS15-097. The update corrects how the\nkernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. \n\nThe update also fixes another critical vulnerability \u2013 this one in OLE Automation, an communication\nmechanism used in its VBScript Scripting Engine. If an attacker got a user running an affected\nsystem to visit a malicious site, they could carry out remote code execution. Users have to apply\nthe OLE Automation patch and the cumulative update in order to be protected, Microsoft cautions. \n\nTuesday\u2019s update also fixes a vulnerability in Silverlight that Microsoft considers important. If an\nattacker got a victim to navigate to a website that contains a specially crafted Silverlight\napplication, they could exploit a vulnerability in the application framework and carry out remote\ncode execution. \n\nThe Flash update bulletin mirrors the one pushed by Adobe earlier this afternoon and fixes\nvulnerabilities in the software on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows\nRT 8.1, and Windows 10. The bulletin will likely be the last Patch Tuesday update that incorporates\nfixes for Adobe\u2019s Flash Player. \n\nThe update will also be Microsoft\u2019s last, at least in its current iteration, for 7, 8.1, Windows\nServer 2008, and Server 2012 until next month, when it transitions to single rollup. The company\nannounced in August it would start bundling together patches in a single update for the operating\nsystems along with .NET Framework patches\u00a0starting in October. \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Nathan Mercer confirmed at the time that updates for Service Stack and Adobe Flash will\nnot be included in future rollups. \n\nThe move to cumulative updates is mostly being done out of convenience and to cut down on update\nfragmentation but experts have already called the technique into question, criticizing the could\nbreak businesses\u2019 legacy mission critical apps. \n\n\u201cThese type of breakage issues could mean less and less companies apply updates because they have to\nkeep business critical applications up and running or risk going out of business,\u201d Chris Goettl, a\nproduct manager at Shavlik Technologies told Threatpost on Monday. \n\nUpdated on Sept. 15 to clarify CVE-2016-3351 affects both Internet Explorer and Edge \n\n", "polarity": 0.016183435739887352, "subjectivity": 0.37523361495135693, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-touts-new-phone-based-login-mechanism/125065/", "date": "2017-04-19T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Microsoft Touts New Phone-Based Login Mechanism", "body": "It likely\u00a0won\u2019t mark the\u00a0death knell of passwords but Microsoft announced this week its giving users\na new way to sign into their accounts without having to enter a lengthy combination of numbers,\nletters and characters. \n\nThe feature, which relies on users having access to their mobile phones, is based around Microsoft\nAuthenticator, a two-factor authentication app the company announced last July and released last\nAugust. \n\nThe feature isn\u2019t so much two-factor as it is one-factor, however. \n\nTo use it, users are encouraged to add their account to either the Android or iOS version of the\napp. When a user goes to sign into a Microsoft accounts property they\u2019ll be prompted on their\ndevice.

Ironically the feature is not yet\navailable for\u00a0Microsoft Authenticator for the Windows Phone. The company claims users of that\nversion of the app comprise less than five percent of all active users. If those numbers change\nMicrosoft says it will add support later down the line. \n\nThe idea of having users rely on their devices for an extra layer of security has been catching on\nas of late. \n\nYahoo unveiled a similar tool, Account Key, for the company\u2019s mobile apps last year. The company\nsaid at the time the mechanism was part of its aim to usher in a \u201cpassword-free future.\u201d The app\ndisplays a push notification when a user attempt to login to one of their services. From there the\nuser taps through to login. \n\nFacebook added a feature in January that lets users tie a physical security key instead of a device\nto their accounts. \n\nUnlike Microsoft\u2019s feature, users still need their passwords to login to the social network. After\ndoing so they\u2019re instructed to tap on a security key, like Yubico\u2019s YubiKey, to verify their\nidentity. \n\nExperts, like Tadd Axon, Microsoft Services Practice Lead at the\u00a0IT consulting firm\u00a0Softchoice,\nstill believe that passwords aren\u2019t going anywhere but think that tools like Microsoft\u2019s\nAuthenticator can help limit their usage. \n\n\u201cThe new functionality in the Authenticator app to use biometrics (in the form of fingerprints from\nApple\u2019s Touch ID), one time codes, and even approvals for a notification from the app (on unlocked\nphones only, naturally) is a significant improvement over password-only authentication,\u201d Axon told\nThreatpost Wednesday. \u201cI view this as a big win for the average user: less reliance on just\npasswords to protect their identity, an easier sign-on experience, and it makes it measurably more\ndifficult for a bad actor to compromise an account \u2013 even if they have the password.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.035926835926835946, "subjectivity": 0.46101361101361105, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-google-to-block-flash-by-default-in-edge-chrome/122542/", "date": "2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft, Google to Block Flash by Default in Edge, Chrome", "body": "The acceleration of Flash\u2019s ride off into the sunset hit top speed with Microsoft on Wednesday\nfollowing up a similar announcement last week from Google that it would block Flash by default in\nthe Edge browser. \n\nGoogle confirmed last Friday that it would be moving to HTML5 by default in Chrome in a measured\nrollout beginning this week with 1 percent of Chrome 55 users. \n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, described how in the next version of Edge, Flash will be blocked by default on\nsites that support HTML5. \n\n\u201cIn these cases, Flash will not even be loaded, improving performance, battery life, and security,\u201d\nsaid Microsoft\u2019s Crispan Cowan, a former Linux security expert and now longtime member of\nMicrosoft\u2019s security operation. \u201cFor sites that still depend on Flash, users will have the\nopportunity to decide whether they want Flash to load and run, and this preference can be remembered\nfor subsequent visits.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft cautioned that it would regulate how quickly it moves to HTML5 by default across the\nboard. For example, Microsoft said the changes would not immediately impact most popular sites still\nreliant on Flash. \n\n\u201cIn the coming months, we will actively monitor Flash consumption in Microsoft Edge and will\ngradually shorten the list of automatic exceptions,\u201d Cowan said. \u201cAt the end of this process, users\nwill remain in control, and will be able to choose Flash for any site they visit.\u201d \n\nThis summer, Apple and Mozilla also said they would begin to reduce their support of Flash in Safari\nand Firefox respectively. While most of these changes are couched in language of features and\nperformance, the shadow cast by constant reports of serious security vulnerabilities in Flash cannot\nbe escaped. \n\nJust this week, the most recent Flash Player update from Adobe included a patch for a zero-day\nvulnerability under attack. This year, there have also been emergency security updates for Flash in\nApril, May, June and in October, proving that attackers still finding ways to exploit victims\nregardless of improvements to the code and swift patching by Adobe. \n\nIn 2015, Adobe took new measures to secure the weak spots in Flash favored by attacks with\nmitigations added to the software to hold off memory-based attacks. Regardless, a report by security\ncompany Recorded Future released last week pointed out that six of the top 10 vulnerabilities used\nin exploit kits were Flash Player bugs; the report singled out a zero-day patched in October 2015\nthat found its way into seven different exploit kits. \n\nA little more than a year ago, Adobe began internal movement away from Flash and toward HTML5, and\nthat it had renamed Flash Professional to Animate and said it would be Adobe\u2019s preferred platform\nfor HTML5 content development. \n\n\u201cOur customers have clearly communicated that they would like our creative applications to evolve to\nsupport multiple standards and we are committed to doing that,\u201d Adobe said in announcing the move. \n\nAs expected, it\u2019s the browser makers that will truly accelerate Flash\u2019s deprecation. Google, for\nexample, said that HTML5 by default will be enabled for 50 percent of Chrome 56 beta users, and when\nChrome 56 stable is rolled out in February, it will be enabled for all users. \n\n\u201cStarting in January users will be prompted to run Flash on a site-by-site basis for sites that they\nhave never visited before,\u201d said Google\u2019s Eric Deily in a post to the Chromium blog last week. \u201cWe\nwant to avoid over-prompting users, so over time we\u2019ll tighten this restriction using Site\nEngagement Index, a heuristic for how much a user interacts with a site based on their browsing\nactivity.

But the flip side to that coin is that\nyou\u2019re going to gather a lot of data about vulnerabilities and attacks. \n\nMicrosoft has been collecting that data for years now and has used it to help inform decisions about\nnew defensive technologies, product improvements and patching strategies. The company shared some of\nthat information Tuesday at the RSA Conference here and some of the data\u00a0they have is\u00a0quite\nrevealing. One of the most intriguing bits to come out of the numbers is that while there are still\nlarge numbers of remote code execution vulnerabilities being disclosed every year, attackers are\nexploiting fewer and fewer of them. \n\n\u201cVulnerabilities represent potential risk. But until somebody goes through the effort to develop an\nexploit that leverages that vulnerability, the risk isn\u2019t actualized. The percentage of remote code\nexecution vulnerabilities that are actually exploited is declining. The actual risk appears to be\ngoing down based on what we see,\u201d said Matt Miller, principal security software engineer in the\nMicrosoft Security Response Center. \u201cThe absolute number of those bugs continues to decline, as\nwell.\u201d \n\nRemote code execution vulnerabilities are attacker catnip, and that\u2019s especially true of RCE bugs in\nwidely deployed software such as browsers and operating systems. For years, attackers had a field\nday with vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Windows, particularly buffer overflows. Rare was\nthe Patch Tuesday that didn\u2019t include fixes for a buffer overflow or six. But Microsoft has put a\nlot of resources and effort into making those bugs more difficult to exploit, and Miller said the\nwork has paid off. \n\nIn fact, he said the company didn\u2019t see a single stack\u00a0corruption exploit in 2014. \n\n\u201cA couple of things have driven that. The Security Development Lifecycle has helped us eradicate\nthese classes of bugs. And we\u2019ve driven mitigations and improvements that have helped too,\u201d Miller\nsaid. \u201cIn practice, this isn\u2019t a vulnerability class that people go after anymore.\u201d \n\nThose changes have forced the attacker community to shift gears. Miller said attackers have started\ntargeting use-after-free vulnerabilities more often and have moved heavily into return-oriented\nprogramming, a technique that can be used to bypass exploit mitigations in software. At the same\ntime, the rise of easily available exploit kits such as Angler, Blackhole and others have made it\nmuch simpler for attackers to go after new vulnerabilities. And the exploits are showing up in those\nkits much more\u00a0quickly than ever before. \n\nDavid Weston, principal program manager on the Microsoft One Protection team, who spoke alongside\nMiller, said that as recently as the beginning of 2014 it was taking roughly 30 days for exploits\nfor a newly patched vulnerability to show up in the common exploit kits.\u00a0By the end of the year, it\nwas within ten days of the patch. And now, not only are the kit developers adding exploits for known\nbugs, but they are in some cases putting in exploits for undisclosed vulnerabilities. \n\n\u201cBy the beginning of this year, we\u2019re seeing the primary exploit kit developers introducing zero\ndays,\u201d Weston said. \u201cThe trickle-down effect is changing, as we\u2019re seeing many more of these\ncrimeware kits source things for themselves.

Experts warn\nthat exploiting the vulnerability is trivial and could lead to remote code execution and privilege\nescalation on a compromised machine. \n\n\u201cWhat this means is that once an attacker knows how to create the \u2018specially crafted HTTP request\u2019\nthey can simply start targeting every web server they can find until they hit one that is\nvulnerable. The first concern is that the work around provided by Microsoft is very limited and\ndoesn\u2019t provide IT admins much to protect themselves while they test and deploy the patch,\u201d said\nAndrew Storms, vice president security services for New Context. \u201cThe second concern is the sheer\nnumber of Windows web servers. There are more Linux servers in terms of total numbers but Windows\nservers are more popular in the corporate environment and many of them store\u00a0very valuable assets.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft said a temporary workaround would be to disable IIS kernel caching, but cautioned that\nthis action could cause performance issue. The vulnerability is not being exploited in the wild,\nMicrosoft said, adding that it\u2019s found in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8 and 8.1,\nWindows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, and in Server Core installation option. \n\n\u201cAn attacker can use the vulnerability to run code on your IIS webserver under the IIS user account.\nThe attacker would then use an exploit for a second local vulnerability to escalate privilege,\nbecome administrator and install permanent exploit code,\u201d said Wolfgang Kandek, CTO at Qualys. \u201cThe\nattack is simple to execute and needs to be addressed quickly, if you cannot patch immediately take\na look at the suggested workaround in IIS caching.

The latest cumulative update for the browser\nincludes a number of fixes for vulnerabilities that were privately disclosed during the Pwn2Own\ncontest last month. \n\nMS15-032 patches 10 vulnerabilities in IE, including nine different memory corruption issues, and an\nASLR bypass, none of which are being publicly exploited. The vulnerabilities range from security\nfeature bypass, to elevation of privilege, to information disclosure, to remote code execution. \n\nThe final critical bulletin, MS15-035, patches a vulnerability in the way Windows processes certain\nEnhanced Metafile (EMF) graphics and images. \n\n\u201cThe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker successfully convinces a user to\nbrowse to a specially crafted website, open a specially crafted file, or browse to a working\ndirectory that contains a specially crafted Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image file,\u201d Microsoft said in\nits advisory. \u201cIn all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to take such\nactions; an attacker would have to convince users to do so, typically by way of enticements in email\nor Instant Messenger messages.\u201d \n\nThere were seven other bulletins released today, all rated important: \n\n \n\nAdobe Patches Flash, ColdFusion, Flex \n\nAdobe released updates today for Flash Player, ColdFusion and Flex. The Flash update patches a\nvulnerability that has been exploited in the wild, Adobe said. \n\nThe Flash update resolves 22 security issues, including CVE-2015-3043, a remote code execution bug\nunder attack. \n\nAffected versions are: Adobe Flash Player 17.0.0.134\u00a0and earlier versions; Adobe Flash Player\n13.0.0.277\u00a0and earlier 13.x versions; Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.451\u00a0and earlier 11.x versions. \n\nThe ColdFusion update, meanwhile, addresses one vulnerability, CVE-2015-0345, an input validation\nbug that is not under attack, Adobe said. \n\nFinally, Adobe\u2019s Flex ASdoc Tool, also patched one vulnerability, CVE-2015-1773, found in the\nJavaScript output of the ASDoc tool in Flex 4.6 and earlier, Adobe said. \n\n\u201cThis vulnerability could lead to\u00a0reflected\u00a0cross-site scripting,\u201d Adobe said in its advisory. \n\n", "polarity": 0.0793141789717132, "subjectivity": 0.46636363636363637, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-to-support-ssh-in-windows/113120/", "date": "2015-06-03T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Dennis Fisher", "title": "Microsoft to Support SSH in Windows", "body": "After several false starts, Microsoft finally is planning to support SSH in Windows and the\ncompany\u2019s engineers also will contribute to the OpenSSH project. \n\nWhile SSH has been a popular tool for remote login and command execution on many Unix and linux\nsystems for years, Windows has not supported SSH by default, for a variety of reasons.

Furthermore, it will not be\nenough to merely disable search protection, developers will have to completely rid their wares of\nany search protection code, no matter how long it lie dormant. \n\nMicrosoft began blocking programs that prevent or limit users from viewing or modifying browser\nfeatures or settings late last year. Starting June 1, the tech giant will take the next step,\ndetecting software that prevents users from changing default search engines and home pages.\nMicrosoft will also move to classify as malicious programs that attempt to circumvent consent\ndialogue boxes on June 1 as well. \n\n\u201cWorking with us can help reduce the risk of having programs with search protection functionality\nturned off, but still containing non-compliant code, being detected as developers work on completely\nremoving the non-compliant code,\u201d the Microsoft Malware Protection Center is telling developers. \n\nThis move represents a significant step in regulating coercive software and development policies.\nFor years, software makers have deployed search protection features in an effort to surreptitiously\ncontrol the browsing behavior and limit the decision-making capacity of their users. While Microsoft\nis by no means the first security product to deem search protect malicious, it is certainly among\nthe most influential. \n\n", "polarity": 0.023809523809523808, "subjectivity": 0.41321428571428565, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-edge-browser-seen-as-a-big-security-upgrade/112738/", "date": "2015-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Dennis Fisher", "title": "Microsoft Edge Browser Seen as a Big Security Upgrade", "body": "For many years now, the browser has been the most dangerous piece of software on most users\u2019\nmachines. Attackers love to target browsers and a remote code execution bug in a major browser is\ngold for them. The browser vendors have been making gradual changes to better protect users in\nrecent years, and now Microsoft is completely revamping the security of its main browser, adding a\nslew of new protections and exploit mitigations. \n\nThe browser included with the upcoming release of Windows 10 will be known as Edge, and it will have\na number of security features designed to protect against the most common memory corruption and\nphishing attacks. And, significantly, Edge will not include support for many of the more dangerous\nand commonly abused extensions, such as ActiveX and VB Script. \n\nMost of the changes that Microsoft is making with Edge are behind the scenes and won\u2019t be visible to\nusers. That includes the new exploit mitigations and some improvements to the sandbox, which was\nintroduced in Internet Explorer 7 several years ago. Edge will include two features designed to\nprotect against memory corruption attacks, MemGC and Control Flow Guard, that are on by default. The\nformer is a mitigation that will help the browser defend against attacks on use-after-free\nvulnerabilities, which have become prevalent recently. \n\n\u201cMemGC (Memory Garbage Collector) is a memory garbage collection system that seeks to defend the\nbrowser from UAF (Use-after-free) vulnerabilities by taking responsibility for freeing memory away\nfrom the programmer and instead automating it, only freeing memory when the automation has detected\nthat there are no more references left pointing to a given block of memory,\u201d Crispin Cowan, senior\nprogram manager for Microsoft Edge, wrote in a post detailing the new features. \n\nControl Flow Guard, meanwhile, is tasked with preventing attackers from taking over vulnerable apps. \n\n\u201cThe end-game in memory-corruption is for the attacker to gain control of the CPU program counter,\nand jump to a code location of the attacker\u2019s choice. CFG (Control Flow Guard) is a Microsoft Visual\nStudio technology that compiles checks around code that does indirect jumps based on a pointer,\nrestricting these jumps to only jump to function entry points that have had their address taken.\nThis makes attacker take-over of a program much more difficult by severely constraining where a\nmemory corruption attack can jump to,\u201d Cowan said. \n\nThe changes to the Edge sandbox improve upon the model of Protected Mode, the sandbox-like\ntechnology that Microsoft introduced in IE 7. That technology has been modified and improved over\nthe years, but the Edge browser will include a substantially different sandbox. \n\n\u201cIE10 introduced EPM (Enhanced Protected Mode) based on Windows 8\u2019s app container sandbox. EPM\nprovided a much stronger sandbox than protected mode, including for example deny-by-default and no-\nread-up semantics. EPM was on by default in the immersive browser, but was only an option on the\ndesktop in IE10 and IE11 because some browser extensions are not compatible with EPM,\u201d Cowan said. \n\n\u201cMicrosoft Edge is rebooting our browser extension model, allowing it to run its content processes\nin app containers, not just as a default, but all the time. Thus every Internet page that Microsoft\nEdge visits will be rendered inside an app container, the latest and most secure client-side app\nsandbox in Windows.\u201d \n\nAnother major change in Edge will be the exclusion of support for ActiveX and other extensions.\nActiveX has been a security liability on\u00a0Internet Explorer, as have other extensions, and attackers\noften target them as an easy way to take over the browser itself. Cowan said Microsoft is developing\na new extension model based on HTML5, which obviates the need for older extensions. \n\n\u201cSo to make browsers safer against attacks, and just more reliable, it is important to create an\nextension model that is safer, by sharing less state between the browser itself and the extensions.\nThus Microsoft Edge provides no support for VML, VB Script, Toolbars, BHOs, or ActiveX. The need for\nsuch extensions is significantly reduced by the rich capabilities of HTML5, and using HTML5 results\nin sites that are interoperable across browsers,\u201d Cowan said. \n\nSecurity experts say the changes made for the new Edge browser are necessary and should have a good\naffect on user security. \n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of users, the Internet is the browser. If Microsoft wants to continue to\ncompete in the marketplace, they need to step up their game for browser security\u2026 and they have been\nlosing to Google now for a few years,\u201d said Andrew Storms, vice president of security services at\nNew Context, said. \n\n\u201cWhen it comes to protecting the browser itself, Microsoft has been making some pretty big leaps\nforward in terms of security. We have to continue to applaud them for making the right decisions.\nFor example, the choice to remove support for antiquated and insecure technology like ActiveX is a\nmove long overdue. Better containerization of the application and better memory protections are also\nmuch needed and appreciated steps in the right direction,\u201d Storms said. \n\nWindows 10 is due to be released later this year, and Microsoft is offering a new bug bounty for\nresearchers who find vulnerabilities in the Edge browser during the technical preview period. \n\n", "polarity": 0.11267965367965371, "subjectivity": 0.49893217893217895, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-remote-code-execution-bugs-in-ie-font-drivers-windows-journal/112762/", "date": "2015-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches Remote Code Execution Bugs in IE, Font Drivers, Windows Journal", "body": "Patch Tuesday as we know it may be on its last legs, but it\u2019s certainly not going quietly. \n\nA little more than a week after Microsoft announced how it would revamp patch distribution and\nsecurity updates starting with Windows 10, the company today released its scheduled round of\nbulletins\u201413 in all, including three critical updates for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer,\nMicrosoft Font Drivers, and Windows Journal, all of which lead to remote code execution. \n\nWith Windows 10 due before the end of the summer, admins had better start thinking about revamping\ntheir patch assessment and prioritization processes if they\u2019re going to upgrade to the new version\nof the Windows OS. With Windows Update for Business, patches will be available as they\u2019re ready, and\nfeatures built into the tool will allow IT managers to decide which machines are patched on quicker\ncycles, and which have to wait until testing is complete, for example. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the vulnerability parade is likely to let up; Qualys for example, says that the\npace of this year\u2019s bulletins and patches has already exceeded each of the last five years and\nfigures to top 150 by year\u2019s end. \n\nToday\u2019s update runs the usual spectrum of products affected by the respective bulletins. The almost-\nhabitual Internet Explorer cumulative update, MS15-043, is likely the highest priority; it patches\n22 vulnerabilities that enable not only remote code execution, but also security feature bypasses,\ninformation disclosure and elevation of privileges. For Windows clients, most of the IE bugs are\nrated important by Microsoft; those rated critical include 14 memory corruption vulnerabilities in\nIE6-11. The bulletin also takes care of a number of ASLR bypass vulnerabilities in IE or VBScript\nand an IE Clipboard information disclosure issue. \n\nMS15-044 patches more TrueType font vulnerabilities, this time in Windows, .NET, Office, Lync and\nSilverlight, and fixes how the Windows DirectWrite library handles TrueType and OpenType fonts.\nTrueType font vulnerabilities have caused trouble before; in 2013, Microsoft patched a separate\nvulnerability that led to kernel compromises and remote code execution. Font-parsing vulnerabilities\nhave also been part of high-profile APT-style targeted attacks, including Duqu. \n\nThe TrueType bug is the more serious of the two, and could lead to remote code execution if the\nrespective products fail to properly handle TrueType fonts, Microsoft said. The OpenType bug is an\ninformation disclosure flaw and could allow an attacker to read data meant to be private; hackers\ncould not exploit this to run code or elevate privileges, Microsoft said. \n\nThe final critical bulletin, MS15-045, is another remote code execution issue, this time in Windows\nJournal, Microsoft\u2019s note-taking program, and can be exploited if a user opens a malicious Journal\nfile. The bulletin patches six vulnerabilities; Microsoft proposes a temporary workaround of either\nnot opening Journal files or removing the .jnt file association. \n\n\u201cThe vulnerability with Windows Journal is particularly interesting in the target scenario, where an\nadministrator is opening a journal file to determine or diagnose a problem, and the tools we\u2019re\ngiven to manage problems are at the same time being used to penetrate the target host, and open you\nup for further attacks,\u201d said Jon Rudolph, principal software engineer at Core Security.\u00a0\u201cThis most\nlikely would not be aimed at the typical user, but someone with admin permissions.\u201d \n\nExperts warn that the Office bulletin MS15-046, though rated important, should merit a second look\nbecause it enables remote code execution, as does the SharePoint bulletin, MS15-047. \n\nThe Office and SharePoint bulletins, however, are replacements for a number of older bulletins\nreleased earlier this year. If admins have not yet applied the older updates, they need apply only\ntoday\u2019s. \n\nAnother bulletin rated important that deserves extra attention is MS15-051, which patches six\nelevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers, one of which, CVE-2015-1701,\nhas been publicly disclosed and Microsoft said it is aware of limited targeted attacks going after\nthis bug. The patch addresses an issue where the kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects n\nmemory; an attacker with local access could then run code in kernel mode. \n\nThe remaining Important bulletins are as follows: \n\n", "polarity": 0.060920090838123615, "subjectivity": 0.45570488254914476, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-laps-tool-tackles-common-local-admin-password-problem/112627/", "date": "2015-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft LAPS Tool Tackles Common Local Admin Password Problem", "body": "Microsoft\u2019s release last week of the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) takes some steps\nto address an old question of what to do with local admin passwords, but doesn\u2019t provide a complete\nanswer, experts said. \n\nWindows admins have long used a common local account with the same password on computers in the same\ndomain. This provides attackers with a single point of failure to target; one password affords\naccess to every machine. What the LAPS tool does is set a random password for the common local admin\naccount on machines in the same domain, Microsoft said. \n\n\u201cDomain administrators using the solution can determine which users, such as helpdesk\nadministrators, are authorized to read passwords,\u201d Microsoft said in an advisory published on\nFriday. \n\nThe availability of LAPS is a big deal for enterprises, for example, that built homegrown solutions\nthat presented some implementation and/or support challenges that frustrated enterprises. Companies\nthat set common passwords do so in the name of efficiency and ease of manageability, which in this\ncase works against any security in place by creating a domain filled with PCs with the same admin\npassword. \n\n\u201cWhat to do with all those local admin passwords has always been source of frustration for IT ops\nteams,\u201d said Andrew Storms, vice president of security services for New Context. \u201cWhat\u2019s ironic for\ncompanies that manage many Windows computers is those that have spent the time and resources to\ncreate an automated build system where all the end user computers are identical are also the ones at\nthe most risk.\u201d \n\nAn attacker who managed to steal the common password could pull off dangerous attacks in the context\nof the domain administrators, including Pass-the-Hash credential replay attacks. In these attacks,\nif a hacker can gain access to the local admin password hash, he can use that rather than a\nplaintext password to gain access to services. This can allow an attacker to elevate privileges and,\nin this case, access any computer on a domain. \n\n\u201cLAPS simplifies password management while helping customers implement recommended defenses against\ncyberattacks,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cIn particular, the solution mitigates the risk of lateral escalation\nthat results when customers use the same administrative local account and password combination on\ntheir computers.\u201d \n\nWhile the LAPS solution is considered past due from Microsoft, it will help enterprises automate\ntheir management of local admin passwords. \n\n\u201cThe typical methods today of storing all those passwords in a spreadsheet or setting them all to\nthe same single password is simply unmanageable from both an operational and security standpoint,\u201d\nStorms said. \n\nMicrosoft said LAPS now stores the random password for each machine\u2019s local administrator account in\nActive Directory. The passwords are kept in a \u201cconfidential attribute\u201d in the PC\u2019s Active Directory\nobject. \n\n\u201cThe computer is allowed to update its own password data in Active Directory, and domain\nadministrators can grant read access to authorized users or groups, such as workstation helpdesk\nadministrators,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cThe solution is built on Active Directory infrastructure and does\nnot require other supporting technologies. LAPS uses a Group Policy client-side extension (CSE) that\nyou install on managed computers to perform all management tasks. The solution\u2019s management tools\nprovide easy configuration and administration.\u201d \n\nBy storing passwords in AD, has Microsoft merely created a different appealing target? \n\n\u201cWhile the solution looks promising, it also appears to simply move the problem and not necessarily\nsolve it completely,\u201d Storms said. \u201cMicrosoft is now storing the passwords in Active Directory. This\nmeans that if the attacker gets into Active Directory, then they have access to the entire kit and\ncaboodle.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": -0.030481078061723225, "subjectivity": 0.3783183214634828, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-launches-project-spartan-bounty/112396/", "date": "2015-04-22T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Launches Project Spartan Bounty", "body": "Microsoft today kicked off a two-month bug hunt for vulnerabilities in Project Spartan, the\ncompany\u2019s new browser set to launch alongside Windows 10 later this year, one of several announced\nadditions to its various bounty programs. \n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s new browser will be the onramp to the Internet for millions of users when Windows 10\nlaunches later this year,\u201d wrote Jason Shirk on the Microsoft Security Response Center blog.\n\u201cSecuring this platform is a top priority for the browser team.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft said the Project Spartan bounty will pay up to $15,000 for remote code execution and\nsandbox escape vulnerabilities, and for design-level bugs.

Sofacy is generally thought to have ties to Russian military intelligence\nand its targets are strategic, such as government and diplomatic agencies, military and defense\ncontractors, and public policy think-tanks. \n\nGoogle\u2019s disclosure on Oct. 31 came 10 days after it privately reported the vulnerability to\nMicrosoft, along with a Flash zero day to Adobe also used in these attacks. \n\nAdobe patched the Flash vulnerability with an emergency update released on Oct. 26, but Microsoft\nfailed to publicly acknowledge the bug until only after Google publicly disclosed it. Google\u2019s\ninternal policy gives vendors seven days to publicly report or patch vulnerabilities being actively\nexploited. \n\nGoogle said the vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that leads to a\nsandbox escape. \n\n\u201cIt can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a\nwindow handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD,\u201d Google\u2019s Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard said in their\ndisclosure. \n\nThe attackers chained this bug and the Flash zero day in order to get on targeted computers.

One, MS16-132, included\nanother vulnerability under attack in the Windows Graphics Component. Microsoft said a remote code\nexecution Open Type Font vulnerability was patched in the Windows font library. \n\nThat bulletin patched three other flaws, including an information disclosure flaw in Open Type Font,\nspecifically in the ATMFD component, which leaks enough information to carry out a further\ncompromise. Also addressed was a remote code execution memory corruption vulnerabilities in Windows\nAnimation Manager and Windows Media Foundation. \n\nMicrosoft also provided cumulative updates for its browsers, Edge and Internet Explorer. The Edge\nupdate, MS16-129, patched 17 vulnerabilities, most of which lead to remote code execution. Two of\nthe flaws, CVE-2016-7209 and CVE-2016-7199, were publicly disclosed, Microsoft said, but not used in\nin-the-wild attacks. The second disclosed bug was also patched in the Internet Explorer update,\nMS16-142, which patched seven CVEs. \n\nMS16-130 patched three critical Windows bugs, a remote code execution flaw in the way Windows\u2019 image\nfile loading handles malformed image files, along with two elevation of privilege flaws in Windows\nIME and Windows Task Scheduler. \n\nAnother remote code execution vulnerability was addressed in MS16-131 in the Microsoft Video Control\ncomponent. The remaining critical bulletin is the Adobe Flash Player update for IE and Edge; Adobe\nreleased an update today for Flash Player patching nine remote code execution flaws in the software. \n\nThough rated important by Microsoft, an Office bulletin, MS16-133, also merits attention because it\npatches a dozen vulnerabilities including 10 that lead to remote code execution. None of the Office\nbugs are being publicly attacked, Microsoft said. \n\nMicrosoft also patched SQL Server, addressing a half-dozen elevation of privilege and information\ndisclosure vulnerabilities in MS16-136.

Google said yesterday it privately disclosed\nboth zero days, which were used in tandem in these targeted attacks against unknown victims, to\nMicrosoft and Adobe on Oct. 21. Adobe rushed an emergency patch for Flash Player on Oct. 26, while\nMicrosoft had yet to acknowledge the vulnerability until Google\u2019s disclosure.

First, an exploit was used against the Flash vulnerability, a use-after-free flaw in\nActionScript runtime code running in the software. Once Flash was compromised in order to gain\ncontrol of the browser process, the attackers used a second exploit to target a Windows kernel\nvulnerability, present in Windows Vista through current versions of Windows 10, to elevate\nprivileges and escape the browser sandbox. From there, they were able to install a backdoor and gain\npersistent access on the victim\u2019s computer in order to send more commands to move stolen data off\nthe machine. \n\nMicrosoft said that the particular win32k kernel component targeted in these attacks had been\nrecently updated with new exploit mitigations that should prevent the exploits from working.\nMicrosoft also said that the backdoor DLL used in these attacks can be blocked via strict Code\nIntegrity policies, which Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser does natively. It\u2019s unknown whether the attacks\nwere successful. \n\n\u201cThis does not guarantee that attackers will not find an alternative workaround, but Microsoft will\nissue a comprehensive update to address the issue soon,\u201d Myerson said. \n\nYesterday\u2019s abrupt disclosure by Google was in accordance with its internal policies, which gives\nvendors 60 days to patch critical vulnerabilities, or notify users about the risk and any\nworkarounds or temporary mitigations, and seven days to at a minimum report on critical flaws under\nactive exploitation. \n\n\u201cSeven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their\nproducts, but it should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as\ntemporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information,\u201d\nGoogle said in 2013 upon publicizing its disclosure policy. \n\n", "polarity": 0.06505804801259346, "subjectivity": 0.4305145611963795, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-unveils-cloud-based-fuzz-testing-service/120938/", "date": "2016-09-28T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Microsoft Unveils Cloud-Based Fuzz-Testing Service", "body": "Microsoft announced a cloud-based fuzz testing service called Project Springfield that identifies\nsoftware bugs in applications that could turn into vulnerabilities. \n\nThe service,\u00a0announced at this week\u2019s Microsoft 2016 Ignite technology conference in Atlanta,\ncombines\u00a0artificial intelligence and fuzz testing tools to examine Windows binaries, Microsoft said.\nCode is run through the service which is\u00a0meant to stress the software into crashing.

The technology was meant to stand up to attacks that had long\nago figured out how to bypass previous-generation protections such as Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Protection (DEP). \n\nHowever, as every new security wall is put up, researchers and hackers alike try to find ways over,\nunder or through it. \n\nControl Flow Guard is no exception. \n\nOn Friday, at DerbyCon in Louisville, Ky., researcher Jared DeMott of Bromium is expected to deliver\na talk on a CFG bypass. DeMott told Threatpost that Bromium disclosed the technique to Microsoft\nbefore Black Hat, but the company has decided not to fix it and that it was not worthy of a bounty. \n\nMicrosoft declined to comment; DeMott said Microsoft told Bromium the bypass doesn\u2019t affect all\nsystems and that it would be a difficult attack vector to exploit. \n\n\u201cThey said it really only affects 32-bit apps running on 64-bit machines, and that it doesn\u2019t affect\nall systems,\u201d DeMott said. \u201cMy response to them was that IE runs as 32-bit by default on 64-bit\nWindows and this still fully affects the browser.\u201d \n\nDeMott said that his bypass takes advantage of Microsoft\u2019s choice not to deploy Control Flow\nIntegrity over Control Flow Guard. \n\n\u201cWhen Control Flow Integrity is implemented, it adds extra checks before a function pointer call is\nmade and a return address is returned, making those the only valid places to return to,\u201d DeMott\nsaid. \u201cMicrosoft didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to fully implement Control Flow Integrity; Control\nFlow Guard protects function pointers only, not return addresses.\u201d \n\nControl Flow Guard, which is a Visual Studio technology, was also built into Microsoft\u2019s new Edge\nBrowser, which made its debut earlier this summer. A previous bypass of CFG was disclosed in March\nby researchers at Core Security. \n\n\u201c[CFG] compiles checks around code that does indirect jumps based on a pointer, restricting these\njumps to only jump to function entry points that have had their address taken,\u201d Microsoft describe\nupon in a report explaining the security features of the Edge browser. \u201cThis makes attacker take-\nover of a program much more difficult by severely constraining where a memory corruption attack can\njump to.\u201d \n\nThe key to DeMott\u2019s bypass, he said, is the ability to corrupt a return address and kick off a\nseries of events leading to a return-oriented programming (ROP) chain that is central to so many\nmemory-corruption attacks. The Bromium technique is called Stack Desync and relies on the use of\ndifferent function calling conventions, he said. \n\n\u201cIf you mix and match them, when you call a function pointer and the system expects a standard\nconvention, but gets another, the stack desyncs and returns an arbitrary address,\u201d DeMott said. \u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t protect the return addresses, the model is broken. \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t protect the return address, you\u2019re leaving exposed the ability for something like what\nwe\u2019re doing. It\u2019s possible to shuffle things around on the stack so that a call will return, not to\na valid address, but to the start of an attack instead.\u201d \n\nSuch a bypass is not trivial to pull off and is likely the playground of a nation-state of\nintelligence-agency backed operation. The attack provides a point of entry onto a network, opening\nthe door to secondary attacks leading to data loss or privilege escalation. \n\n\u201cThis is the next evolution of the typical cat-and-mouse game that is memory corruption,\u201d DeMott\nsaid. \u201cAll this research, even though it sounds bad, it\u2019s pushing ball forward and raises bar for\nattackers. [Microsoft] chose not to fix it and felt like they did the best they could with it and\nnot fully repair it. There\u2019s some slight risk here and the technique we used doesn\u2019t exist\neverywhere.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": -0.04238437001594895, "subjectivity": 0.5787480063795855, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/suspicious-windows-7-update-actually-an-accidental-microsoft-test-update/114860/", "date": "2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Suspicious Windows 7 Update Actually an Accidental Microsoft \u2018Test\u2019 Update", "body": "A suspicious Windows 7 update today raised concern on a number of Microsoft and technology forums\nthat the Windows Update service had been compromised.

The browser makers plan to sever support for RC4 in late January, early February 2016. \n\nMozilla\u2019s Richard Barnes said the shut-off date should coincide with the release of Firefox version\n44, slated for Jan. 26. Google\u2019s Adam Langley said the Chrome release will reach a stable channel in\neither January or February, but would not specify a date, only that HTTPS servers supporting only\nRC4 will stop working. \n\n\u201cDisabling RC4 will mean that Firefox will no longer connect to servers that require RC4,\u201d Barnes\nsaid in a post to the Mozilla developer platform forum. \u201cThe data we have indicate that while there\nare still a small number of such servers, Firefox users encounter them at very low rates.\u201d \n\nLangley wrote to the security@chromium.org mailing list: \u201cWhen Chrome makes an HTTPS connection it\nhas an implicit duty to do what it can to ensure that the connection is secure. At this point, the\nuse of RC4 in an HTTPS connection is falling below that bar and thus we plan to disable support for\nRC4 in a future Chrome release.\u201d \n\nCurrently, Firefox Beta and Release versions do not restrict RC4, but yet only 0.05 percent and 0.08\npercent of connections to the respective versions use RC4. Google\u2019s numbers are slightly higher for\nChrome, 0.13 percent. \n\n\u201cEven then, affected server operators can very likely simply tweak their configuration to enable a\nbetter cipher suite in order to ensure continued operation,\u201d Langley wrote. \n\nMicrosoft announced end of life for RC4 in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11, and that it will\nbe disabled by default. \n\n\u201cMicrosoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 only utilize RC4 during a fallback from TLS 1.2 or 1.1 to\nTLS 1.0. A fallback to TLS 1.0 with RC4 is most often the result of an innocent error, but this is\nindistinguishable from a man-in-the-middle attack,\u201d said David Walp, Senior Program Manager,\nMicrosoft Edge. \u201cFor this reason, RC4 will be entirely disabled by default for all Microsoft Edge\nand Internet Explorer users on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 starting in early 2016.\u201d \n\nFor more than a decade, researchers have been poking holes in RC4, finding biases in the stream\ncipher\u2019s not-so random bytes used to encrypt plaintext. An attacker with enough time and processing\npower and access to enough TLS requests could figure out plaintext. \n\nIn 2013, research done by the University of Illinois\u2019 Daniel J. Bernstein arrived at a practical\nattack against a known weakness in RC4 that leads to a TLS session compromise, one of the first\nfeasible attacks to be made public. \n\nIn July, Belgian researchers published attacks against RC4 that allows a hacker to capture and\ndecrypt a cookie much quicker than ever before. \n\nThe paper \u201cAll Your Biases Belong To Us: Breaking RC4 in WPA-TKIP and TLS,\u201d written by Mathy Vanhoef\nand Frank Piessens of the University of Leuven, explains the discovery of new biases in the\nalgorithm that led to attacks breaking encryption on websites running TLS with RC4, as well as the\nWPA-TKIP, the Wi-Fi Protected Access Temporal Key Integrity Protocol, in order to recover cookies. \n\nVanhoef and Piessens explain how an attacker can use these findings to decrypt a user\u2019s website\ncookie, for example, that should be secured over an encrypted channel. Their attacks, however, are\nnot limited to cookies. \n\n\u201cThis means the attacker can perform actions under the victim\u2019s name (e.g. post status updates and\nsend messages), gain access to personal information (e.g. to emails and chat history), and so on,\u201d\nthe academics said. \n\n", "polarity": 0.052596015096015095, "subjectivity": 0.47325757575757577, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-critical-vulnerabilities-in-new-edge-browser/114226/", "date": "2015-08-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches Critical Vulnerabilities in New Edge Browser", "body": "Microsoft Edge wasted no time making its presence felt on Patch Tuesday today when Microsoft\nreleased the first security bulletin for the company\u2019s new browser. \n\nReleased two weeks ago along with the public debut of Windows 10, Edge, like its big brother\nInternet Explorer, got its own critical cumulative update today with patches for four\nvulnerabilities, including a trio of memory corruption vulnerabilities and an ASLR bypass. \n\nThe Edge bulletin, MS15-091, is one of 14 bulletins, four of which are rated critical, including a\nseparate cumulative update for Internet Explorer, MS15-079. None of the Edge vulnerabilities have\nbeen publicly disclosed or exploited, but the same cannot be said for IE; CVE-2015-2423, an unsafe\ncommand line parameter passing vulnerability, has been publicly disclosed and affects not only IE,\nbut also Windows and Office. It has not been exploited publicly, Microsoft said. \n\nMicrosoft promised enhanced security with Edge by adding new memory protections such as MemGC\n(Memory Garbage Collector) that defends against use-after-free bugs, and removing support for\ntoolbars and Browser Helper Objects, ActiveX, VML and VB Script. Another memory protection called\nControl Flow Guard (CFG) constrains memory corruption attacks from freely moving about. \n\nMicrosoft said the three memory corruption vulnerabilities in Edge enable remote code execution\nattacks, while the ASLR bypass also leads to remote code execution if chained together with an\nexploit for a separate vulnerability. \n\nThe Internet Explorer bulletin includes patches for 13 vulnerabilities in the browser. The publicly\ndisclosed vulnerability is rated important on Windows clients going back to Internet Explorer 7, and\nrated low on Windows Servers. \n\n\u201cAn information-disclosure vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, and\nMicrosoft Office when files at a medium integrity level become accessible to Internet Explorer\nrunning in Enhanced Protection Mode (EPM),\u201d Microsoft said in the bulletin. \u201cTo exploit this\nvulnerability, an attacker would first need to leverage another vulnerability and execute code in\nInternet Explorer with EPM, and then execute Excel, Notepad, PowerPoint, Visio, or Word using an\nunsafe command line parameter. The update addresses the vulnerability by improving how Notepad and\nMicrosoft Office programs are executed from Internet Explorer.\u201d \n\nAs a temporary workaround, Microsoft suggests either removing notepad.exe from the IE elevation\npolicy, or removing IE elevation policies for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Visio. Microsoft today\nalso released two other bulletins related to this vulnerability, MS15-088 and MS15-081, both of\nwhich it said must be applied in order to be fully protected. \n\nThe rest of the IE bulletin patches 10 memory corruption vulnerabilities and two ASLR bypasses; all\nof the memory-related bugs could lead to remote code execution, as do the ASLR bypasses if chained\ntogether with other exploits. \n\nThe Office bulletin, MS15-081, patches eight remote code execution vulnerabilities including\nCVE-2015-2423. Microsoft patched five memory corruption vulnerabilities where Office improperly\nhandles objects in memory that could be exploited by a malicious Office document sent via email or\nhosted online. \n\nA separate Office RCE vulnerability was patched in which Office failed to properly validate\ntemplates. A crafted file could be emailed or hosted online, or in a man-in-the-middle attack, a\ntemplate could be modified with malicious code, Microsoft said. \n\nThe remaining Office bug is an integer underflow vulnerability where Office decreases an integer\nvalue beyond its intended minimum value, Microsoft said, adding that it could be exploited via a\nmalicious Office doc sent via email or hosted online. \n\nMS15-080 is the remaining critical bulletin and patches 16 vulnerabilities in Microsoft Graphics\nComponent. Most of the vulnerabilities involve font parsing issues in a number of Windows\ncomponents, including the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library, the Windows DirectWrite library,\nOffice, the Windows kernel, Windows shell and other OS processes. \n\nThere are a half-dozen remote code execution OpenType font parsing vulnerabilities, five TrueType\nfont parsing vulnerabilities, and a RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Office Graphics Component\naddressed in this bulletin. The bulletin also includes patches for a kernel ASLR bypass, a Windows\nkernel-mode driver security bypass, a Windows Shell security bypass, and an elevation of privilege\nvulnerability in the Windows Client-Server Run-time Subsystem. \n\nTwo other bulletins, MS15-082 and MS15-083, also address remote code execution vulnerabilities in\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Server Message Block (SMB) respectively, but were rated important\nby Microsoft. \n\nThe remaining bulletins were also rated important: \n\n", "polarity": 0.047505543237250536, "subjectivity": 0.38558758314855873, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-usb-related-flaw-used-in-targeted-attacks/114240/", "date": "2015-08-12T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches USB-Related Flaw Used in Targeted Attacks", "body": "It used to be that dropping a USB stick in a parking lot in the hope that someone plugs the\nmalicious peripheral into an important computer was the realm of penetration testers and ambitious\nnation-state actors. \n\nThat\u2019s just not so anymore.

The flaw, Microsoft\nsaid, is being exploited in targeted attacks and patching this vulnerability should be prioritized. \n\nMicrosoft rated the vulnerability (CVE-2015-1769) \u201cimportant\u201d because it requires local access to a\nmachine to exploit.

Attackers used USBs to infect computers with the malware at the Natanz uranium enrichment\nfacility in Iran; Stuxnet-infected machines spread the malware to USBs and other peripherals\nconnected to the computer in the hopes of spreading the attack to air-gapped machines. \n\nThis vulnerability is different, said Craig Young, a security researcher with Tripwire. \n\n\u201cThis flaw allows someone with physical access to an unlocked machine to use the USB drive as an\navenue to write files where the user normally could not,\u201d Young said. \u201cThis makes [elevation of\nprivilege] easy since DLLs can be written to system locations and in general executables run as\nSYSTEM should be replaceable with attacker code.\u201d \n\nStuxnet exploited, among other vulnerabilities, a flaw in the Windows Shell that allowed local users\nand remote attackers to execute code using a malicious .LNK shortcut file. The vulnerability occurs\nbecause the .LNK files are not properly handled during icon display in Windows Explorer and in\nSiemens WinCC SCADA systems. The malware executes by merely visiting a directory hosting the .LNK\nfile. \n\nThe .LNK vulnerability was also exploited by the Equation Group, uncovered by researchers at\nKaspersky Lab, via the Fanny worm. Fanny exploits two zero days also used by Stuxnet and also spread\nover USB sticks to air-gapped computers. \n\nIn March, Microsoft patched the .LNK-related vulnerability again after German researcher Michael\nHeerklotz discovered that the original patch from August 2010 was incomplete. Heerklotz reported the\nbug to HP\u2019s Zero Day Initiative, which said that Windows users had been exposed all along. Heerklotz\nsaid he found a way to bypass Microsoft\u2019s patch by attacking other parts of the .LNK code that was\nnot checked by the original patch. \n\nThe Mount Manager vulnerability patched yesterday is not remotely exploitable. It does allow for\nelevation of privilege and affects supported Windows systems, including Windows 10. \n\n\u201cThis particular vulnerability is a great illustration of the security precept \u2018If I can touch your\ncomputer, it\u2019s not your computer anymore,'\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for organizations to think\nabout the physical security of their systems, and the access controls to prevent unauthorized users\nfrom gaining access to them.

If such an event is recorded, it means that attempt to exploit the\nvulnerability is blocked,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post. \u201cSo once the update is installed,\ncompanies auditing event logs will be able to use this as detection mechanism.

Somewhat less pressing than today\u2019s issue with Adobe Type Manager Library, the\nATMFD issue stemmed from a problem with how it handled objects in memory. If exploited, it could\nhave enabled privilege escalation and code execution. \n\n", "polarity": 0.0797914207005116, "subjectivity": 0.416223927587564, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-hacking-team-windows-kernel-zero-day/113788/", "date": "2015-07-14T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches Hacking Team Windows Kernel Zero Day", "body": "Microsoft has patched a zero-day vulnerability in the Windows kernel uncovered and exploited by\nHacking Team.

It affects Windows Server\nimplementations all the way back to Windows Server 2003. Microsoft rated the vulnerability\n\u201cimportant\u201d because it said an attacker would have to log into a target system and then run\nmalicious code. \n\nMicrosoft said a number of workarounds\u2014including the renaming ATMFD.dll for all affected versions\nexcept for Windows Server 2003\u2014are available and listed in the advisory. \n\nThe Hacking Team zero days overshadowed what should have been today\u2019s defining moment\u2014the end of\nsupport for Windows Server 2003. Nine of today\u2019s 14 security bulletins include patches for the end-\nof-life software. Of the 14 bulletins, four are rated critical and affect Internet Explorer, Windows\nRemote Desktop Protocol, VBScript Scripting Engine, and Windows Hyper-V; all four bulletins address\nremote code execution vulnerabilities. \n\nThe Internet Explorer bulletin, MS15-065, patches 29 vulnerabilities in the browser including four\nthat have been publicly disclosed. One, a Jscript9 memory corruption bug, was part of the Hacking\nTeam disclosures and was reported by Vectra Networks. An ASLR bypass, IE cross-site scripting filter\nbypass, and an information disclosure vulnerability have also been publicly disclosed, Microsoft\nsaid. \n\nAnother critical bulletin to prioritize is MS15-067, a remote code execution vulnerability in RDP.\nThe bug affects Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines and in most instances will crash it; in some cases\nRCE is possible. \n\nAn attacker would need to send specially crafted sequences of packets to a system running RDP in\norder to exploit the flaw and install malicious programs, modify data or create accounts. Microsoft\nsaid the update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the terminal service handles packets. \n\n\u201cThis is very high impact because many businesses rely on remote desktop protocol and many advanced\nhome users configure remote access for RDP into their home,\u201d said Tripwire security researcher Craig\nYoung.\u00a0\u201cThis should definitely be on the top of everyone\u2019s install list. Although Microsoft\ndescribes that code execution is tricky, there are a lot of smart people out there and I\u2019m sure it\nwon\u2019t be long before proof-of-concept code starts floating around.\u201d \n\nThe Hyper-V bulletin, MS15-068, could present problems in cloud-based hosting scenarios. It patches\ntwo RCE vulnerabilities if a malicious application is run by an authenticated and privileged user on\na guest virtual machine hosted on Hyper-V, Microsoft said, adding that an attacker would need valid\ncredentials to attack this bug. \n\n\u201cThe Hyper-V vulnerability could be especially painful in shared hosting environments given that\nprivileged users on guest operating systems can run code on the host operating system, potentially\ncompromising the security of all shared hosting,\u201d said Tyler Reguly, a researcher at Tripwire. \n\nThe final critical bulletin, MS15-066, patches one RCE vulnerability in the VBScript scripting\nengine and affects supported versions of Windows Server. \n\n\u201cIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed\nto exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the\nwebsite,\u201d Microsoft said in its advisory. \u201cAn attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked\n\u2018safe for initialization\u2019 in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering\nengine.\u201d \n\nAnother bulletin worth calling out is a leftover from June, MS15-058, that addresses three RCE\nvulnerabilities in SQL Server. The bulletin is rated \u201cimportant\u201d because an attacker would require\npermissions to create or modify a database, Microsoft said. \n\n\u201cThis issue will be particularly critical for database hosting providers allowing users access to\ncreate and manipulate database schema in a shared environment,\u201d Tripwire\u2019s Young said.\u00a0\u201cSuccessful\nexploitation of this flaw would allow the attacker complete access to the SQL Server by leveraging a\nvery specific edge case.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.13108305647840532, "subjectivity": 0.5043977482465855, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-graphics-component-flaw-under-attack/114575/", "date": "2015-09-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches Graphics Component Flaw Under Attack", "body": "Microsoft today patched a vulnerability in its graphics component present in Windows, Office and\nLync that has been publicly attacked, and is one of five vulnerabilities patched this month that\nhave been publicly disclosed. \n\nMicrosoft released a dozen bulletins today, five of them it rates critical, including separate\nupdates for Internet Explorer and the new Edge browser in Windows 10, the second month in a row Edge\nhas been patched since it was released. \n\nThe Microsoft Graphics Component bulletin, MS15-097, patches 11 vulnerabilities.

According to OWASP, HSTS also stops attackers who use invalid digital certificates.\nThe protocol denies users the ability to override invalid certificate messages. HSTS also protects\nusers from HTTPS websites that also may include HTTP links or serve content unencrypted. \n\nHSTS is already on by default in Internet Explorer 11 available in the Windows 10 Insider Preview\nand the new Microsoft Edge expected to be available when Windows 10 releases later this year. \n\n\u201cSite developers can use HSTS policies to secure connections by opting in to an HSTS preload list,\nwhich registers websites to be hardcoded by Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and other browsers to\nredirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS,\u201d said Kyle Pflug, program manager with the Microsoft Edge team.\n\u201cCommunications with these websites from the initial connection are automatically upgraded to be\nsecure.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft is the last of the major browser vendors to add HSTS support. Google Chrome and Mozilla\nFirefox have supported HSTS since 2011, while Apple added it to Safari upon the release of version\n10.9 of Mavericks. \n\nThe move comes on the heels of Microsoft in May bringing Perfect Forward Secrecy to Windows. Forward\nsecrecy has of late been considered an essential security measure, especially for new applications.\nIt ensures that new private keys are negotiated for every web session, meaning that if a key is ever\ncompromised in the future, only that particular session will be at risk. In order to attack each\nsession, each key would have to be attacked separately. \n\nThe addition of HSTS was included in a cumulative update for Internet Explorer released yesterday.\nThe security bulletin included patches for two dozen vulnerabilities in the browser, most of which\ngave hackers the ability to remotely execute code on a compromised computer. \n\nHSTS also resolves Mixed Content attacks where insecure HTTP script is loaded from a site secured\nvia a HTTPS connection. \n\n\u201cWhen we initially announced HSTS in Windows 10, we noted that mixed content is not supported on\nservers supporting HSTS.

It also planned as of Jan. 1, 2016 to show an \u201cUntrusted Connection\u201d\nerror in Firefox for sites signed with SHA-1 after that date, and after Jan. 1, 2017 to show the\nsame error message whenever its browser ran into a SHA-1 cert. \n\nThat changed after the publication of the report \u201cFreestart collision for full SHA-1.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe are re-evaluating when we should start rejecting all SHA-1 SSL certificates (regardless of when\nthey were issued),\u201d Mozilla said in its Oct. 20 announcement. \n\nThe academic paper, written by researchers Marc Stevens, Pierre Karpman and Thomas Peyrin,\nrespectively of the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica of the Netherlands, Inria of France, and the\nNanyang Technological University of Singapore, describes tweaks to existing attacks and advances in\nanalyzing of the algorithm that drastically reduce the cost and potential time to generate a\ncollision. Those factors in combination with the relative continued health of Moore\u2019s law, which\nstates the computer processing power doubles every two years, significantly reduce the time to\ncreate a collision attack. \n\nThe original estimates for practical SHA-1 collisions were published by cryptographer Bruce Schneier\nin 2012 when he projected that the cost to create a practical SHA-1 collision would be $700,000 by\n2015 and $143,000 by 2018, two figures that are within reach of well-funded hacking teams. \n\nThe new projections, given the relative inexpensive cost of procession power afforded by Amazon EC2,\nfor example, reduces the costs to between $75,000 and $125,000 and the time down to as few as three\nmonths. \n\n", "polarity": 0.02012549739822467, "subjectivity": 0.3553565962656872, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/curious-tale-of-a-microsoft-silverlight-zero-day/115873/", "date": "2016-01-13T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Curious Tale of a Microsoft Silverlight Zero Day", "body": "Microsoft Silverlight vulnerabilities certainly don\u2019t have the same hacker cred as bugs in Adobe\nFlash, for example, but nonetheless, that does not diminish their value, nor does that mean they\nshould be ignored. \n\nMicrosoft patched a critical flaw in the application framework on Tuesday, and researchers at\nKaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team caution that while exploits have been used in\nlimited targeted attacks\u2014contrary to information in Microsoft\u2019s bulletin\u2014it may be a matter of time\nbefore attacks go mainstream. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal; Silverlight vulnerabilities don\u2019t\u2019 come around that often,\u201d said Kaspersky Lab\nresearcher Brian Bartholomew. \u201cExploitation of the zero day itself is fairly technical, but once a\nproof-of-concept falls into the hands of someone who knows what they\u2019re doing and reverse engineers\nthe patch, it\u2019s not that difficult to produce a weaponized version of it.\u201d \n\nThat means that in short order, an exploit used in targeted attacks by sophisticated actors would\nlikely be folded into the leading exploit kits and be available to criminal operations. \n\nKaspersky Lab\u2019s Costin Raiu and Anton Ivanov disclosed the bug to Microsoft after doing some\ndetective work on data exposed in the Hacking Team breach. Prompted by an email from a Russian\nhacker named Vitaliy Toropov to Hacking Team that was published in July by Ars Technica, Kaspersky\nresearchers decided to pursue Toropov\u2019s claims that he had a Silverlight zero day for sale that was\nat least two years old in 2013 and which he said could survive for a few more years without\ndetection. \n\nSilverlight bugs, like security flaws in Flash, allow attackers to hit victims regardless of the\nplatform or browser they\u2019re running. For now, Kaspersky\u2019s Bartholomew said the attacks observed have\ntargeted only Windows machine, but with tweaks, the possibility exists to extend attacks to the Mac\nOS X platform and others. Generally, victims are attacked via links in a spear-phishing email or in\ndrive-by downloads, where the attacker has dropped a malicious Silverlight application on a\nvulnerable webserver. \n\nBartholomew told Threatpost that Kaspersky researchers were able to find an older Silverlight\nvulnerability and proof of concept exploit submitted to Packet Storm that was credited to Toropov.\nThe archive was available for download and included enough resources for Kaspersky researchers this\nsummer to write a YARA rule for the DLL that implemented the exploit. \n\nThe rule was deployed to Kaspersky customer machines and until late November there was nary a hit on\nthe rule. That changed Nov. 25 when one of the generic detections for the 2013 exploit triggered an\nalert from a user\u2019s machine. The file was compiled July 21, fewer than two weeks after the Hacking\nTeam breach was disclosed and data stolen in the attack was dumped online. The zero day was analyzed\nand disclosed to Microsoft, which patched it yesterday; Kaspersky published a technical analysis of\nthe flaw today. \n\nThe vulnerability serves to give an attacker an initial foothold on a compromised machine. From\nthere, additional payloads are served to the infected computer and can lead to the loss of sensitive\ndata or further network infiltration. \n\nAccording to Microsoft, the vulnerability opens the door to remote code execution and affects\nMicrosoft Silverlight 5 and Microsoft Silverlight 5 Developer Runtime; later builds after\n5.1.41212.0 are not affected. \n\nFrom the Microsoft bulletin MS16-006: \n\n\u201cA remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Silverlight decodes strings using a\nmalicious decoder that can return negative offsets that cause Silverlight to replace unsafe object\nheaders with contents provided by an attacker. In a web-browsing scenario, an attacker who\nsuccessfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-\non user.\u201d \n\nThe question remains as to whether this zero day is the same one uncovered in the Hacking Team data\ndump that Toropov tried to sell, or a new one written after the leak. For example, Bartholomew said\nthere are commonalities in both samples that are unique to Toropov. \n\n\u201cNot many people write Silverlight zero days, so the field is narrowed significantly,\u201d Bartholomew\nsaid. \u201cOn top of that, there are some error strings used in his old exploit from 2013 that we\nlatched on to and thought were unique. These were the basis of our rule. \n\n\u201cThis exploit contains the same error strings a .NET application ID that is the same as the old one.\nEvery time you build new app in .NET, you get a new ID. This has the old one. All of this adds to\nthe pile of indicators that point to him.\u201d \n\nHacking Team indicated in its email to Toropov that it was willing to pay him a $20,000 advance for\nthe zero day. Zero day acquisition firm Zerodium posted a price list on its website, and while it\ndoes not list Silverlight specifically, remote code execution vulnerabilities for Flash pay in the\n$80,000 range\u2014and likely more under ground. \n\n\u201cSilverlight zero days are a big deal,\u201d Bartholomew said, \u201cbecause of the potential impact and\nwidespread usage that could happen from this.\u201d \n\n", "polarity": 0.05218524531024531, "subjectivity": 0.43956259018759003, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-denial-of-service-issue-in-hyper-v/115335/", "date": "2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Microsoft Patches Denial of Service Issue in Hyper-V", "body": "In addition to the usual slew of patches Microsoft dropped this week, the company on Tuesday also\naddressed an issue in its hypervisor, Hyper-V, that could lead to a denial of service condition. \n\nMicrosoft warned about the issue in an advisory separate from its usual Patch Tuesday bulletins. \n\nThe native hypervisor can be used to run virtual machines on Windows Server 2008 and some versions\nof Windows 8, and also be\u00a0downloaded and installed as a standalone entity.

In addition to remote code execution, if exploited, some of the\nvulnerabilities could lead to elevation of privilege and spoofing. \n\nOne of\u00a0the more pressing critical updates, MS16-005, affects Windows\u2019 kernel-mode drivers. An\nattacker could bypass the way the interface handles objects in memory and trigger an Address Space\nLayout Randomization (ASLR) bypass. The vulnerability could be exploited if an attacker convinced a\nuser to visit a rigged site, sent a user a booby-trapped email, or tricked a user into navigating to\na malicious file via a network share, Microsoft warns. \n\nFive vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office are addressed by another critical bulletin, MS16-004. If a\nusers\u2019 Access Control Policy settings aren\u2019t properly configured, an attacker could bypass multiple\nsecurity features in SharePoint. Both Visual Basic and Office suffer from a\u00a0bug \u2013 since patched \u2013\nthat could let an attacker bypass ASLR, while Office, and Office software like Visio, Excel, and\nWord are plagued by multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities \u2013 also patched. \n\nAnother critical vulnerability, MS16-006, addresses a runtime remote code execution vulnerability in\nSilverlight, Microsoft\u2019s deprecated application framework. Kurt Baumgartner, Principal Security\nResearcher, at Kaspersky Lab\u2019s GReAT is calling the bug this month\u2019s \u201cmost interesting and most\nrisky,\u201d namely as it implicates those running the software on multiple platforms, including Apple. \n\nTwo other critical updates affect two bugs each in the Internet Explorer (MS16-001) and Edge\n(MS16-002) browsers. The IE updates \u2013 the last users running IE8, 9 and 10 will receive \u2013 resolve a\nmemory corruption vulnerability in VBScript engine and an elevation of privilege vulnerability that\ncomes as a result of not properly enforcing cross-domain policies. Only the first bug could enable\nan attacker to execute arbitrary code, officials warn. The Edge updates fix two memory corruption\nbugs, including one in the Chakra JavaScript engine, and another in Edge itself. \n\nThe last critical update, MS16-003, resolves the same vulnerability in VBScript that exists in\nInternet Explorer.

OWA fails to\nproperly handle web requests, making it easier for an attacker to inject script or content and dupe\nthe recipient of an email into disclosing sensitive information or visiting a shady site. \n\nCraig Young, a security researcher at Tripwire\u2019s Vulnerability and Exposure Research Team (VERT)\nwarned of the issue on Tuesday as well. \n\n\u201cMS16-10 should be on the top of all Outlook Web Access (OWA) administrators. This patch closes\n[four]\u00a0vulnerabilities that could lead to significant and direct financial losses through so called\nbusiness e-mail compromise (BEC),\u201d Young said, \u201cThe ability to make phishing emails legitimately\nappear to come from an internal address is a tremendous advantage for attackers.\u201d \n\nAs you\u2019ve no doubt already heard, the updates of course mark the end of life for IE 8, 9, and 10 \u2013\nsomething that may wind up being a serious problem later down the line.

The report doesn\u2019t specify exactly what the content was or where it was located,\nbut claims the numbers are from Microsoft entities like Bing, OneDrive, and MSN. \n\nThere were many more requests to remove copyrighted information, just north of one million,\naccording to Microsoft. In this case, it was usually URLs that were being shown in Bing searches\nthat contained copyrighted material. Microsoft claims it complied with 92 percent of requests. Since\nthis is an inaugural report however, there are no statistics from last year to compare the numbers\nto. \n\nThe company received 3,546 requests from European residents to remove results for queries in Bing\nthat included their name.

One of the IE bugs,\nreported by researchers at FireEye, has been publicly disclosed, but none of the flaws have been\nexploited in the wild, Microsoft said. \n\nThe Microsoft Edge bulletin, MS15-107, is rated moderate and takes care of a vulnerability that\nenables bypass of the browser\u2019s cross-site scripting filter, and a separate information disclosure\nvulnerability. \n\nThe remaining critical bulletin patches a remote code execution vulnerability in Windows Shell. \n\n\u201cThe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted toolbar\nobject in Windows or an attacker convinces a user to view specially crafted content online,\u201d\nMicrosoft said in advisory MS15-109. \n\nThe remaining bulletins are rated important by Microsoft. \n\nMS15-110 patches three remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, all of which are\nmemory corruption flaws, while MS15-111 is a Windows kernel update that patches five\nvulnerabilities, including three different privilege elevation flaws, a memory corruption issue, and\na Trusted Boot bypass. \n\n", "polarity": 0.02509920634920635, "subjectivity": 0.418882275132275, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-cracks-down-on-toolbars-unsigned-dlls-with-edge-update/115410/", "date": "2015-11-18T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Brook", "title": "Microsoft Cracks Down on Toolbars, Unsigned DLLs with Edge Update", "body": "The security community rejoiced when Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would strip\nmaligned extensions such as\u00a0ActiveX and VB Script \u2013 often bullied in attacks \u2013 from its new Edge\nbrowser. \n\nNow the company claims a recent update\u00a0to the browser prevents the loading of unsigned DLLs without\nconsent, something that should make it more difficult for an attacker to compromise Edge. \n\nIn addition to hardening the browser against attacks, the update should speed up Edge and stop\nunwanted binary extensions and software from running, crashing, or tainting search results with\nmalware. \n\nCrispin Cowan, a senior program manager at the company wrote about the changes in a post to the\nMicrosoft Edge Development blog Tuesday. \n\nIt turns out that when the company pushed an update for Windows 10 last week, they upgraded the\nrendering engine that powers the browser to \u201cEdgeHTML 13,\u201d something that brings kernel-level\nprotection against code injection. Going forward, the mechanism should block DLL injections on the\nbrowser, unless they\u2019re components signed by Microsoft, or Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) Cowan\nclaims. \n\nBy enforcing code integrity within the kernel, as opposed to in the process, the company claims it\nwill make it so ad injectors can\u2019t turn off the integrity check, something a hacker could disable\notherwise. \n\n\u201cThe attacker is trying to colonize the browser, and loading DLLs provides the attacker with a handy\ncargo pallet full of supplies. Blocking unauthorized DLL injection makes browser exploits more\ndifficult and more expensive for attackers to carry out,\u201d Cowan said, adding that\u00a0his team has\nalready seen the change in Edge work wonders for beta users. \n\n\u201cFrom a sample of about 65,000 Windows Insider users\u2026 module code integrity protected 2704 users\nfrom attempts to load adware and malware,\u201d Cowan said. \n\nWhen Microsoft first announced Edge back in May, it claimed the browser would have a handful of\nhidden, built-in security features.

The malware arrives impersonating a Microsoft Word\ndocument carrying the familiar \u201cW\u201d logo, but is in reality a malicious Android application package\n(APK). \n\nOnce a device is infected, the malware operates with elevated privileges, steals device identifiers\n(IMEI and SIM card numbers as well as the device ID), along with personal information belonging to\nthe victim, SMS messages and contact information stored on the phone. \n\nAll of this data is emailed or texted to the attackers, Zscaler director of security research Deepen\nDesai said. \n\n\u201cWe did not see the initial delivery vector here but the fact that it is using a file name\n(wendang.apk translates to data file) and it uses Microsoft Office Word icon \u2013 the malware author is\ntrying to fool the end user into thinking it is an important document file that the user will be\ninterested in,\u201d Desai said. \u201cOnce the user opens up the document file he or she will actually be\ngoing through an APK installation process leading to infection.\u201d \n\nOnce the malware is installed on the phone, for example, it drops a Word doc icon onto the home\nscreen. The victim taps to open the file, but instead executes the malware, which also delivers an\nerror message to the user and removes the icon from the home screen. The malicious app then executes\na number of things in the background, including sending all SMS messages to a number coded into the\nmalware. It also starts an Android service called MyService and two threads (SMSTask and MailTask)\nthat run in the background. The malware is also capable of dialing out to numbers coded into the\nmalware. \n\n\u201cThe malware authors have implemented a functionality in the APK file that allows them to send phone\nnumbers to the infected device via SMS,\u201d Desai said. \u201cThe malware will intercept such messages and\ndial the number. The premium number business model appears to be the most likely use case here where\nthe attackers will get paid for the calls made.\u201d \n\nThe privacy concerns are alarming, Desai noted. He points out that SMS messages could contain not\nonly personal interactions, but also mobile banking and other verification codes for online\nservices. \n\n\u201cConsidering that all the messages on the infected devices were getting sent to the attacker \u2013 the\nattacker may further perform some filtering for the data of interest,\u201d Desai said. \u201cThe stolen\ncontact information may be used for further spreading the malware. The stolen credentials and\nbanking related data will most likely be used to perform financial fraud.\u201d \n\nDesai said the campaign was detected Oct. 10 and Zscaler was able to retrieve from the command and\ncontrol admin panel lists of stolen data sent to the attacker indicating more than 300 victims in\nless than a month of operations. \n\n\u201cDue to the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, its no wonder that PC based malware techniques are\nappearing in mobile domains,\u201d Desai said. \u201cIn early Windows malware attacks, attackers would often\nname the malicious files with eye-catching titles and use common icons to entice victims to open the\nfile.

Those targets are\nlargely government and diplomatic agencies and individuals in India and Asia, as well as satellite\noffices of those agencies in Europe and elsewhere. \n\nThe Office flaw was patched in September in MS15-099 and updated again in November. Yet APT groups\nseem to be capitalizing on lax patching inside these high-profile organizations to carry out\nespionage. Some criminal organizations have also made use of exploits against this particular flaw,\nin particular against financial organizations in Asia, Kaspersky researchers said in their report. \n\nThe APT groups, however, seem to be having the most ongoing success with CVE-2015-2545. Kaspersky\nLab identified a half-dozen groups, including two new outfits, that have been using modified\nexploits for the flaw. \n\nThe new players are known as Danti and SVCMONDR. Danti is a relative newcomer operating since 2015\nand primarily against Indian government organizations. It has recently branched out against targets\nin Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines, Kaspersky said. \n\nIn February and March, researchers saw Danti attacks moving via spear-phishing emails laced with a\n.docx file that exploits the Microsoft flaw and drops custom shellcode on compromised machines. \n\n \n\n\u201cThe exploit is based on a malformed embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object,\u201d Kaspersky\nresearchers wrote in their report. \u201cThis contains the shellcode that drops a backdoor, providing\nfull access to the attackers.\u201d \n\nThe February attacks were concentrated against the Indian Ministry of External Affairs starting Feb.\n2 and concluding Feb. 29, the report says. Indian embassies in Hungary, Denmark and Colombia were\nalso targeted. \n\nThe emails contained relevant subject lines to the targets and spoofed legitimate email addresses\nbelonging to high-ranking officials, including the IT director of India\u2019s Ministry of Communications\nand Information Technology. \n\nIn March, the Danti group struck again, in particular against a number of people inside the Cabinet\nSecretariat of Government India from an email spoofing a high-ranking government official. A\nmodified version of previous EPS exploits dropped a backdoor and other capabilities that monitored\nsystem information and gave the attackers the ability to modify files, execute commands, terminate\nprocesses and gain a shell. \n\nSVCMONDR used spear-phishing messages to hit targets in Taiwan with exploits that hint at a\nconnection to the Danti group as well as APT 16, what is thought to be a separate APT gang. However,\nits emails came from the same domain as the SVCMONDR attackers, using different shellcode and\ndropping a new backdoor. \n\nThe EPS exploits drop a program called SVCMONDR.exe that embeds itself in the registry for\npersistence and that establishes a backdoor through which commands and stolen files are sent. \n\nKaspersky\u2019s report also implicates the Platinum APT group as the first to exploit CVE-2015-2545.\nPlatinum was identified by Microsoft; it used EPS exploits against targets in India as early as last\nAugust. A recent Microsoft reports described some of Platinum\u2019s exploits, including its ability to\nabuse a hotpatching feature introduced in Windows in 2003 and available until it was removed in\nWindows 8. The abuse of hotpatching allows the attackers to inject malicious code into running\nprocesses without having to reboot the server. Hotpatching requires admin privileges, therefore the\nattackers have to already be on the box to make use of this technique. Kaspersky also said in\naddition to APT 16, which targeted news agencies in Taiwan late last year, another APT group known\nas EvilPost has been exploiting the EPS flaw. \n\nEvilPost used the EPS exploit to hit defense contractors in Japan; in one attack described by\nKaspersky, EvilPost attackers used an embedded and maliciously crafted EPS object embedded in an\nOffice document to run a shell on compromised machines and drop a separate DLL that exploited\nCVE-2015-1701, a privilege escalation vulnerability. With elevated permissions, the attackers were\nthen able to backdoor systems and reach out to command servers to download more malware. \n\nThe Kaspersky report, however, said that the attackers no longer have access to a command server in\nJapan and theorize either it was compromised or the attackers abandoned their mission after\nresearchers discovered it. \n\nThe remaining APT group outed by Kaspersky is called Spivy; it targeted organizations in Hong Kong\nand used a variant of the Poison Ivy backdoor to steal information. \n\nTechnical information and indicators of compromise are available on Securelist.com. \n\n", "polarity": 0.21385506854256853, "subjectivity": 0.4725807178932178, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-moves-against-bad-passwords/118330/", "date": "2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Microsoft Moves Against Bad Passwords", "body": "With the scourge of digital credential theft on the rise Microsoft is urging IT admin to button-up\ntheir networks and get serious about passwords and account security. The IT behemoth posted on\nTuesday a best practices cheat sheet for administrators along with updating customers on some of the\ncompany\u2019s latest security tools for keeping accounts safe. \n\nMicrosoft wrote in a blog post by its Active Directory Team that it is responding to last week\u2019s\nrevelation that a 2012 LinkedIn data breach compromised 117 million user credentials. The fallout\nfrom the LinkedIn breach is that tens of millions of those usernames and passwords could possibly be\nused to unlock other accounts. That, security experts say, should strike fear in the hearts\u2019 of IT\nadministrators. \n\nBut according to Robyn Hicock, a program manager on Microsoft Identity Protection Team, with good\naccount hygiene a breach similar in size to LinkedIn\u2019s shouldn\u2019t have CIO biting their nails.\nHicock, who penned Tuesday\u2019s whitepaper about good account practices (PDF), said follow Microsoft\u2019s\nsuggestions and companies can avoid the collateral damage of compromised credentials that comes with\nmassive data breaches. \n\nFor starters Hicock said take everything you thought you knew about passwords, and think again. \n\nShe said common approaches to password management don\u2019t work, such as IT admins who\u00a0enforce\nrequirements on password length, complexity and impose regular and periodic password expirations. \n\nThese above requirements actually make passwords easier to crack, she said. \u201cWhy you might ask?\nBecause humans act in pretty predictable ways when faced with these kinds of requirements,\u201d Hicock\nwrote. \n\nRequiring the use of multiple character sets is counter intuitive to good password hygiene because\nmost people use similar patterns when using them. She said forcing users to change their passwords\nfrequently also doesn\u2019t make passwords more secure because people too often just use one bad\npassword after another. \n\nAlso not making passwords more secure was increasing their length. \u201cPasswords greater than about 10\ncharacters can result in repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword,\u201d Hicock\nwrote. Passwords longer than 10 characters are even worse because people are more apt to re-use them\nacross other accounts and or store them in unencrypted documents on their PC or in the cloud. \n\nFor these reasons, Microsoft has stepped up its practice of banning bad or common passwords. \n\n\u201cWe see more than 10 million accounts attacked daily, so we have a lot of data about which passwords\nare in play in those attacks,\u201d Hicock said. \n\nMicrosoft has added a feature called\u00a0Dynamically Banned Passwords to its Microsoft Account Service\nplatform that prevents users from choosing a common password. Microsoft said it will be adding the\nfeatures to Azure Active Directory customers in private beta form \u201cover the next few months.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhen it comes to big breach lists, cybercriminals and the Azure AD Identity Protection team have\nsomething in common \u2013 we both analyze the passwords that are being used most commonly. Bad guys use\nthis data to inform their attacks,\u201d Hicock wrote. \n\nThe Dynamically Banned Passwords feature cross references current attack lists so they don\u2019t work\nagainst your network. When security systems detect fraudulent password guessing attempts online, the\naccount gets locked. \n\nThat\u2019s when Microsoft\u2019s second password protection measure kicks in called Smart Password Lockout.\nAs the name suggests, this feature will lockout and lock up an account that an unknown user is\ntrying to access. At the same time, the genuine account holder will be alerted to the fraudulent\nattempt to access the account, but would not be locked out. Microsoft said it does this by\n\u201cdetermining the risk associated with a specific login session.\u201d \n\n\u201cMore than half the time, we keep hackers from disrupting you or your users,\u201d Hicock wrote. \n\nEssential to Smart Password Lockout is enforcing multi-factor authentication registration. \u201cEnsure\nyour users maintain current security information (like an alternate email address, phone number, or\ndevice registered for push notifications) so they can respond to security challenges and be notified\nof security events,\u201d Hicock wrote. \n\nOf course the most important point here is good passwords are vitally important. Topping that list\nis to ban the use of common passwords that are easy pickings for brute force attacks.

For many,\nMicrosoft\u2019s stance lends an important and powerful voice to ongoing efforts to reform the Electronic\nCommunications Privacy Act that is at the heart of Microsoft\u2019s beef with the government. \n\n\u201cWe applaud Microsoft for challenging government gag orders that prevent companies from being more\ntransparent with their customers about government searches of their data,\u201d said Andrew Crocker,\nstaff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \n\nFor Crocker and Microsoft, the stance is tied to bigger issues such as free speech and First\nAmendment rights. \u201cIn nearly all cases, indefinite gag orders and gag orders issued routinely rather\nthan in exceptional cases are unconstitutional prior restraints on free speech and infringe on First\nAmendment rights,\u201d he said. \n\nThe software giant\u2019s chief legal officer Brad Smith said Microsoft said it has been required to\nmaintain secrecy about more than 2,500 legal demands over the past 18 months. More than 1,752 (68\npercent) of those secrecy orders had no end date. Smith noted that, \u201cThis means we effectively are\nprohibited forever from telling our customers that the government has obtained their data.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s lawsuit challenges gag order provision in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act\n(ECPA) that allows courts to force companies that offer cloud storage to say nothing when asked to\nturn over customer data. Reforms of ECPA have been long fought by privacy advocates such as the\nElectronic Privacy Information Center. \n\nAlan Butler, senior counsel at Electronic Privacy Information Center said that such secret orders by\nthe government should be the exception, but increasingly the requests have become the rule. \u201cNotice\nis one of the key protections provided under the Fourth Amendment, and law enforcement efforts to\ndelay or otherwise restrict notice should be viewed skeptically by the courts,\u201d he said. \n\nFor the ACLU, it used Microsoft\u2019s lawsuit as an opportunity for Congress to implement reforms on the\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act. \u00a0\u201cIf Congress fails to include those changes as it considers\nECPA reform, then the courts should step in, including in Microsoft\u2019s case, to end the government\u2019s\nconstitutional failure to provide notice,\u201d said Alex Abdo, staff attorney with the \u00a0ACLU in a\nstatement. \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s lawsuit is the latest in a string of high-profile battles with the government over\nprivacy issues. Last week, tech firms and privacy advocates banded together to voice opposition to a\ndraft bill, Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016. Then, of course, there is \u00a0Apple and its\nbattle with the government\u2019s demands to help it crack its own encryption in order to break into an\niPhone. \n\nControversial aspects of ECPA have been debated for years. In fact, earlier this week the House\nJudiciary Committee amended a current ECPA reform bill \u2014 the Email Privacy Act \u2014 by removing a\nprovision that also attempts to fix notice requirement. The timing of Microsoft\u2019s suit is\nfortuitous, Butler said.  \n\n\u201cI think this lawsuit will provide a much needed venue to address the lack of notice for email\nwarrants,\u201d Butler said. \u201cCongress has had the opportunity in the past to address this problem, but\nhas not yet taken the steps necessary to do so. The court should reaffirm that notice is a critical\ncomponent of government searches under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d he said. \n\nAs for Microsoft\u2019s hope of victory? EFF\u2019s Crocker said Microsoft has a strong case. \u201cGiven the\nnumbers Microsoft lists in the complaint and the statute\u2019s failure to comport with the First\nAmendment, I think there\u2019s a pretty good likelihood the suit will at the minimum force some changes\nto the government\u2019s practices or ECPA,\u201d Crocker said.  \n\nBecause of the secret nature of such requests, it\u2019s impossible to tell how many secret government\ninformation requests businesses receive. One estimate from a 2012 report authored by Texas Southern\nUniversity\u2019s Thurgood Marshall School of Law called \u201cGagged, Sealed & Delivered\u201d (PDF), estimates\n30,000 electronic surveillance orders approved by magistrate judges each year.  \u201cIndividuals have a\nconstitutional right to receive notice when their persons, papers, and effects have been subject to\nsearch. The denial of this right is\u00a0a harm, and prevents realistic engagement by the public on an\nissue of national importance (privacy),\u201d EPIC\u2019s Butler said. \n\n", "polarity": 0.1056689342403628, "subjectivity": 0.5077853363567648, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-zero-day-exposes-100-companies-to-pos-attack/118026/", "date": "2016-05-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Microsoft Zero Day Exposes 100 Companies to PoS Attack", "body": "More than 100 North American companies were attacked by crooks exploiting a Windows zero day\nvulnerability. The attacks began in early March and involved the zero day vulnerability\n(CVE-2016-0167) reported and partially fixed in April\u2019s Patch Tuesday security bulletins\u00a0by\nMicrosoft. The zero day was found by researchers at FireEye, who on Tuesday\u00a0disclosed details. \n\nFireEye said the flaw is a local elevation of privilege flaw in the win32k Windows Graphics\nsubsystem. Attackers are able to exploit the flaw once they are able to remotely execute code on the\ntargeted PC. Microsoft patched the vulnerability on April 12 and released a subsequent update\n(MS16-062) on Tuesday. \n\nFireEye said attacks leveraging the zero day flaw are targeting point-of-sale payment card systems\nused by retail, restaurant and hospitality verticals. The multi-stage attacks began, FireEye\nreports, with tailored spear phishing campaigns that contained variations of Microsoft Word\ndocuments embedded with macros that, when enabled, downloaded and executed a malicious downloader\nthat FireEye calls PUNCHBUGGY. \n\nPUNCHBUGGY, FireEye said, is\u00a0a dynamic-link library (DLL) that is capable of obtaining additional\ncode via an HTTPS connection. \u201cThis downloader was used by the threat actor to interact with\ncompromised systems and move laterally across the victim\u2019s network,\u201d according to the authors of the\nFireEye report. \n\nNext, FireEye said, criminals used tools, including a \u201cpreviously unknown elevation of privilege\n(EoP) exploit and a previously unnamed point of sale memory scraping tool\u201d that researchers named\nPUNCHTRACK malware. PUNCHTRACK is loaded and executed by an obfuscated launcher and is never saved\nto disk, researchers said. \n\nThe attackers are the only group it has observed to use the downloader PUNCHBUGGY in tandem with the\nPOS malware PUNCHTRACK, FireEye said. \n\n\u201cThis actor has conducted operations on a large scale and at a rapid pace, displaying a level of\noperational awareness and ability to adapt their operations on the fly. These abilities, combined\nwith targeted usage of an EoP exploit and the reconnaissance required to individually tailor\nphishing emails to victims, potentially speaks to the threat actors\u2019 operational maturity and\nsophistication,\u201d FireEye wrote. \n\nThe specific exploit used by the attackers to execute remote code centered on a use-after-\nfree\u00a0vulnerability (Win32k!xxxMNDestroyHandler). This type of vulnerability refers to an attacker\naccessing memory after it has been freed. This can cause a program to crash or can result in the\nexecution of arbitrary code. In this case, attackers use the use-after-free\u00a0vulnerability to\ndownload the CVE-2016-0167 exploit and run the subsequent code as SYSTEM. \n\n\u201cThe exploit uses SetSysColors() to perform heap Feng Shui which manipulates the layout of the heap\nby carefully making heap allocations,\u201d FireEye wrote. Simply put, attackers are able to corrupt the\nsystem memory, execute code and create trusted user-mode shellcode. \u201cThe shellcode then steals the\nSystem process token to elevate a child cmd.exe process,\u201d FireEye reports. \u00a0The attack is designed\nto scrape both Track 1 and Track 2 payment card data, FireEye said. \n\nThe latest Windows updates address CVE-2016-0167, and fully protect systems from exploits targeting\nCVE-2016-0167. As a precaution, FireEye also recommends users\u00a0disable Office macros in their\nsettings and for enterprise administrators to\u00a0enforce a Group Policy to control macro execution for\nall Office 2016 users. \n\nSecurity experts say, as more U.S. companies snuff out point of sale malware by deploying chip-and-\nPIN bankcard technology, attackers are rushing to exploit existing magnetic strip card systems still\nvulnerable to malware. FireEye, for example, reported last month that that a group of hackers that\ngo by the name Bears Inc. are behind the latest barrage of attacks with a custom-built point of sale\nmalware called Treasurehunt. This latest zero day vulnerability follows the same trend. \n\n", "polarity": 0.10201719576719576, "subjectivity": 0.46650132275132283, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/old-exploits-die-hard-says-microsoft-report/117918/", "date": "2016-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Old Exploits Die Hard, Says Microsoft Report", "body": "Microsoft\u2019s Security Intelligence Report painted a bleak picture when it comes to malware,\nfraudulent login attempts and the staying power of really old exploits.

Data is culled from its own internet\nservices and more than\u00a0600 million computers worldwide running services such as Windows Defender and\nthe Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool. \n\nCertainly, there were plenty of bright spots in the report, especially if you lived in North America\nwhere, according to Microsoft, we are one of the least likely to become infected compared to other\nparts of the world. Another bright spot overall, while exploits and malware attacks are on the rise\nthe number of times attackers successfully infect are declining. \n\nBut the \u201ctoo long: didn\u2019t read\u201d takeaway is simple for Microsoft\u2019s SIR. \u201cThreats don\u2019t change as\nfast as we think they do. Many of the issues we are faced with today are the same as they have been\nfor years,\u201d said Dan Guido a security expert and founder of Trail of Bits. \u201cMany of the exploits and\nmalware out there only affect older systems, and Microsoft has done a great job at designing Windows\n10 and other, current generation, software to avoid them entirely. One of the easiest ways you can\nremove yourself from harm\u2019s way is to buy a new computer and get rid of an older one.\u201d \n\nVulnerabilities \n\nThe longer version, Microsoft observed a rise in vulnerability disclosures of 9.4 percent in the\nsecond half of 2015 compared to the previous six months. Fifty percent of those vulnerabilities were\nconsidered medium risk by Microsoft. Disclosures of high-severity vulnerabilities increased 41.7\npercent across the industry in the second half of 2015, accounting for 41.8 percent of all\nvulnerabilities. \n\nAttack vectors for those vulnerabilities were most likely third-party Windows applications followed\nby the core operating system, then OS applications and web browsers, according to Microsoft. \n\nExploit Kits \n\nQuarterly trends for the top 10 malware and unwanted software families detected on domain-joined\ncomputers in 2H15, by percentage of computers encountering each family. \n\nAfter decreasing steadily for more than a year, encounters with exploit kits increased by more than\na third from the third quarter of 2015 compared fourth, according to Microsoft. Exploit kits\nremained the most commonly encountered type of exploit in the second half of the year, with an\nencounter rate more than four times that of the next most common type of exploit, according\nMicrosoft. \n\nThe most predominant exploit kit was Angler, and the most targeted operating system flaw was\nCVE-2010-2568, a vulnerability in Windows Shell. CVE-2010-2568, a vulnerability well known for its\nusage in the Stuxnet malware family in June 2010, has had a patch available since Aug. 2,\u00a02010 but\nmany systems are still being successfully targeted. \n\n\u201cRecently, the industry has seen a rise on attacks exploiting 10-year-old vulnerabilities to gain\naccess and encrypt systems. The question is, why haven\u2019t these old vulnerabilities been fixed yet?\u201d\nsaid Gavin Millard, EMEA Technical Director for Tenable Network Security. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important\nthat organizations don\u2019t forget to patch the long forgotten vulnerabilities still lingering that can\nbe easily exploited,\u201d he said. \n\nMalware on the Move \n\nTop categories of malware and unwanted software detected by Windows Defender and System Center\nEndpoint Protection at Microsoft in 2H15 \n\nAs for malware, according Microsoft, the number of worldwide PC hit with attempted malware infection\nin the second half of 2015 shot up to 20 percent compared to the previous year, a 6 percent rise.\nRansomware accounted for less than 0.5 percent of malware that attempted to infect Windows PCs.\nRansomware, Microsoft reported, is being used by attackers more judiciously in targeted attacks. \n\nTwo new browser modifiers, Win32/Diplugem and Win32/SupTab, were primarily responsible for the\nincreased encounter rate of malware for in the third quarter of 2015. \n\nOne interesting malware finding, PCs managed by IT are much less likely to encounter malware, with\nabout 11 percent of domain-joined PCs encountering malware in the fourth quarter, compared to about\n22 percent of non-domain-joined systems, according to Microsoft. \n\nPassword Attacks \n\nMicrosoft tapped intelligence from Microsoft Accounts (Outlook.com, OneDrive and Skype) and also its\nAzure Active Directory (used for Office 365, Box and cloud apps) and measured how many times and how\nsuccessful attackers were at compromising accounts via phishing, brute force, social engineering,\nand other types of attacks. \n\n\u201cFrom all this data gathering and analysis, each day Microsoft\u2019s account protection systems\nautomatically detect and prevent more than 10 million attacks, from tens of thousands of locations,\nincluding millions of attacks where the attacker has valid credentials,\u201d according to Microsoft. \n\nMicrosoft reports its accounts have in excess of 13 billion logins per day, of which 10 million\nattempts are flagged as fraudulent. \n\nCaptain Obvious Recommendations \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s recommended solutions won\u2019t surprise any seasoned security experts.

Now those losing sleep over the feature can get some rest; Microsoft\nquietly announced last week it\u2019s snuffing out the feature. \n\nLater this summer, when Microsoft rolls out a massive update to Windows 10 called Anniversary\nEdition, notably missing will be the controversial Wi-Fi Sense feature. \n\nMicrosoft introduced Wi-Fi Sense with the debut of Windows Phone 8.1 in April of 2014, but it didn\u2019t\nbecome widely noticed until the release of the Windows 10 OS in October of the same year. The\nfeature is designed to make it easier to share your Wi-Fi password with trusted friends. That was\nthe idea, at least. \n\nThere was near immediate condemnation of Microsoft for introducing the feature. Worried Windows 10\nusers wrongly feared the default Wi-Fi Sense feature allowed any of their closest Facebook, Outlook\nand Skype friends to have access to passwords associated with their personal and corporate networks. \n\nDespite cries by Microsoft and other privacy experts who tried to comfort the paranoid that the sky\nwas not falling, the Wi-Fi Sense feature has been widely panned by\u00a0users and is now getting the axe,\naccording to Microsoft. \n\nIn post to Microsoft\u2019s TechNet website announcing a preview build (14342) of the Anniversary Edition\nof Windows 10, Gabe Aul, corporate vice president, of Microsoft\u2019s Engineering Systems Team said the\ncost of updating the Wi-Fi Sense code to keep the feature working coupled with its low usage and low\ndemand no longer justifies its existence. \n\n\u201cWe have removed the Wi-Fi Sense feature that allows you to share Wi-Fi networks with your contacts\nand to be automatically connected to networks shared by your contacts,\u201d Aul wrote. \n\nHowever, Aul wrote, \u201cWi-Fi Sense, if enabled, will continue to get you connected to open Wi-Fi\nhotspots that it knows about through crowdsourcing.\u201d \n\nGoing forward users will\u00a0want double-check Wi-Fi Sense to make sure it\u2019s turned off. \n\nWith\u00a0Wi-Fi Sense, Windows 10 would automatically share Wi-Fi encrypted password information with\nyour Outlook and Skype contacts by default. Users also had the option of sharing Wi-Fi passwords\nwith Facebook friends, but had to take a separate step to do so. \n\nThe security concerns were two-fold. One, sharing your own Wi-Fi network with someone you are\nmarginally connected to via Skype, Facebook or Outlook hardly seemed prudent. Equally as concerning\nis automatically being logged into a Wi-Fi network run by contact you may hardly know. \n\nBut lost in the outcry against Wi-Fi Sense were its safeguards. For example, with Wi-Fi Sense, your\nactual password was never shared. Rather, the password stays encrypted and stored in the cloud. When\na contact comes within range of your Wi-Fi hotspot and is using\u00a0Windows 10 on their device, they\u2019d\nhave access to an encrypted version of your Wi-Fi credentials and be able use only your Wi-Fi (no\naccess to local resources permitted) without having to request to see the password. Microsoft argued\nthis was more convenient and safer than writing the hotspot password down on a piece of paper that\ncould easily lost or stolen. \n\nAdditionally, Wi-Fi Sense did not work with corporate networks that use additional authentication\nprotocols such as 802.1x EAP and WPA2 Enterprise. Microsoft also stressed Wi-Fi Sense only shared\nyour passwords with direct contacts, and not friends-of-friends, as many news outlets erroneously\nreported. Lastly, even though the feature was turned on by default, users were still prompted to\nclick \u201cshare my network with my contacts\u201d when logging into their own Wi-Fi network. \n\nMicrosoft won\u2019t say when its Windows 10 Anniversary Edition will be available, but there are a\nnumber of reports that the OS update will arrive this June or July. \n\nFor those\u00a0who will miss the feature, there are other similar Wi-Fi password sharing initiatives you\ncan get behind. For starters, The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been promoting a similar\nconcept called Open Wireless Movement. Comcast announced a \u201cNeighborhood Hotspot initiative\u201d where\nits combo residential wireless router and cable modem broadcast a Wi-Fi signal for private use and a\nsecond \u201cneighborhood xfinitywifi\u201d network signal that can be shared with other Xfinity customers. To\na lesser extent, Apple added to its AirPort base stations a feature called Guest Network that limits\nguest access to a network\u2019s Wi-Fi only without having to share a network password. \n\n", "polarity": 0.01479700854700855, "subjectivity": 0.4704059829059828, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-unleashes-13-bulletins-six-critical/117356/", "date": "2016-04-12T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Tom Spring", "title": "Microsoft Unleashes 13 Bulletins, Six Critical", "body": "Microsoft today released a lucky 13 bulletins for April, with six rated critical and the others\nimportant. In total, Microsoft patched 29 unique CVEs for this round, with the most anticipated\npatch tied to Badlock. \n\nMicrosoft addressed a number of critical browser vulnerabilities found in Internet Explorer and\nEdge. In the case of IE, Microsoft warned (MS16-037) the browser could allow remote code execution\nif a user views a specially crafted webpage. \n\nAs for the Edge (MS16-038) bulletin, Microsoft said it has fixed a vulnerability tied to the way the\nbrowser handles objects in memory and how it handles cross-domain policies. Either could give\nattackers the same user rights as the current user and allow for remote code execution. \n\nOther impacted software for the remaining critical patches include Adobe Flash Player (MS16-050),\nMicrosoft Office (MS16-042), Microsoft XML Core Services (MS16-040) and Microsoft Graphics Component\n(MS16-039). \n\nCelebrity vulnerability Badlock was the most anticipated of the lot. The vulnerability (MS16-047) is\na man-in-the-middle attack that targets Remote Procedure Call traffic and allows attackers to force\na downgrade of the authentication level of the SAM and LSAD channels, and then allow an attacker to\nimpersonate an authenticated user. Badlock, despite the hype, fell flat and was rated only important\nby Microsoft. \n\nMore critical bulletin was in Microsoft Office (MS16-042) that allowed an attacker to cook-up a\nspecial Microsoft Office file that if opened would unleash an attack allowing for arbitrary code run\non a targeted system. \n\nPerennial vulnerability candidate Adobe Flash Player also received a critical (MS16-050) update.\nThis security update resolved issues tied to the way the player installed on Windows 8.1, Windows\nServer 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, and Windows 10. Microsoft would only say the\nupdate fixed Adobe Flash libraries contained within Internet Explorer 10, Internet Explorer 11, and\nMicrosoft Edge. \n\nAnother critical update (MS16-040) is tied to Microsoft XML Core Service, a set of services that\nallow applications written in Jscript, VBScript and Microsoft development tools to be used together\nto build Windows-native XML-based applications. Microsoft said the vulnerability could allow remote\ncode execution if a user clicks a specially crafted link that could allow an attacker to run\nmalicious code remotely to take control of the user\u2019s system. \n\nThe last critical vulnerability mentioned is tied to Microsoft Graphics Component (MS16-039) and the\nway the feature interacts with Microsoft Windows, Microsoft .NET Framework, Microsoft Office, Skype\nfor Business, and Microsoft Lync. Microsoft said it fixed how the Windows font library handles\nembedded fonts. It wrote, a specially crafted document could allow for remote code execution. It\nalso noted, if a webpage contained a specially crafted embedded font, it could be game over for an\nOffice user who would then be vulnerable to a remote attack. \n\nImportant patches addressed a denial of service vulnerability flaw found in way Microsoft handles\nHTTP.sys (MS16-049). Another important fix addressed a Client/Server Run-Time Subsystem flaw\n(MS16-048) that could allow security features to be bypassed if an attacker logs on to a targeted\nsystem and runs a specially crafted application. \n\nMicrosoft also said important updates included (MS16-046), a Secondary Logon flaw that could allow\nan attacker to run arbitrary code as an administrator. Of interest to enterprise customers, was the\nimportant update that fixed Windows Hyper-V virtualization software (MS16-045). According to\nMicrosoft the vulnerability allowed attackers to create specially designed application that cause\nthe Hyper-V software to run arbitrary code. \n\nThe last two include important vulnerabilities related to Microsoft Windows OLE (MS16-044) and .NET\nFramework (MS16-041). In the case of the Microsoft Windows OLE flaw, the vulnerability could allow\nan attacker to execute malicious software on a targeted system after the victim was tricked into\nclicking on a specially crafted program embedded in an email or website. In the case of the \u00a0.NET\nFramework vulnerability, an attacker could gain local system access if a victim launched a malicious\napplication. \n\n", "polarity": 0.09595648604269293, "subjectivity": 0.5260878489326767, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-patches-critical-vulnerabilities-in-its-browsers/116664/", "date": "2016-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Patches Critical Vulnerabilities in its Browsers", "body": "Microsoft released a baker\u2019s dozen worth of security bulletins on Tuesday, including five rated\ncritical and two rated important that could result in remote code execution attacks against\ncompromised machines. \n\nTwo of the bulletins rated critical address flaws in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. The IE\nbulletin, MS16-023, patches 13 vulnerabilities in the browser, all of which are memory corruption\nflaws impacting IE 9-11, including IE 11 on Windows 10. More than half of the 13 flaws do not impact\nIE 9 or 10, Microsoft said, but those that do are in line for attacks resulting in remote code\nexecution. None of the flaws have been publicly disclosed or exploited. \n\nThe same goes for MS16-024, the Microsoft Edge bulletin. All 11 flaws are memory corruption\nvulnerabilities and five of those are also applicable to IE, Microsoft said. Edge also is vulnerable\nto an information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2016-0125, enabled by Edge\u2019s improper handling of\nthe referrer policy. An attacker could use this flaw to learn about the request context or browsing\nhistory of a user, Microsoft said. \n\nThe memory corruption flaws affecting both browsers, Microsoft said, are related to the way IE and\nEdge access objects in memory. An attacker hosting an exploit online would have to convince the\nvictims to view the site, either via phishing, drive-by download attacks, or instant messages with\nlinks to the malicious sites. Successful exploits give the attacker the same privileges as the user. \n\nMicrosoft also issued a bulletin, MS16-026, patching two flaws in Windows Graphic Fonts. A user\nwould have to open a crafted document to exploit the flaw or view a website hosting maliciously\ncrafted embedded OpenType fonts. \n\nOnly one of the OpenType Font Parsing vulnerabilities, CVE-2016-0121, is rated critical and leads to\nremote code execution; the other, CVE-2016-0120, is a denial-of-service issue and is rated moderate\nby Microsoft. \n\nThe flaw exists in Windows because of the way the Windows Adobe Type Manger Library handles these\nspecially crafted fonts, Microsoft said, and a successful exploit could allow an attacker to install\nmalware, manipulate data, or create new accounts. \n\nA separate update, MS16-027, patches two flaws in Windows Media that can be exploited via malicious\nmedia content to gain remote code execution. Neither CVE-2106-0101, nor CVE-2016-0098, has been\npublicly attacked, Microsoft said, adding that the patch corrects the way Windows handles resources\nin the media library. \n\nThe final bulletin rated critical by Microsoft, MS16-028, addresses two flaws in the Windows PDF\nLibrary that could be exploited to gain remote code execution if a user is tricked into opening a\nmalicious .pdf file. \n\nQualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek cautioned that organizations should prioritize MS16-026, MS16-027 and\nMS16-0280. \n\n\u201cThey all attack complex formatting issues in the Windows Media Player in the MPEG video format, in\nthe OpenType fonts with a circular reference abusing recursion and in the PDF reader missing\nboundary check in the PostScript interpreter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe continuous stream of vulnerabilities in\nthese areas indicates just how complex the media formats are that we dealing with everyday.\u201d \n\nMS16-029, meanwhile, patches three flaws in Office and Office Services and Web Apps, two of which\nlead to remote code execution via memory corruption issues and another that bypasses security\nfeatures. This update also includes a new version of Microsoft Word, which has been a vehicle used\nin many targeted attacks. \n\n\u201cWord is\u00a0frequently used to carry exploits, both in online documents as well as e-mail attachments,\u201d\nKandek said. \u201cThe vulnerabilities\u00a0allow the attacker to get RCE on the target machines and should be\naddressed as quickly as possible.\u201d \n\nThe security feature bypass affects versions of Office dating back to 2007. \n\n\u201cA security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software due to an invalidly\nsigned binary. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a similarly\nconfigured binary to host malicious code,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cA defender would then not be able to\nrely on a valid binary signature to differentiate between a known good and a malicious binary.\u201d \n\nThe final bulletins addressing remote code execution flaw in Windows are MS16-025 and MS16-030.\nMS16-025 patches a vulnerability in Windows, which occurs because the OS fails to validate input\nbefore loading certain libraries. An attacker would need local access to exploit the bug by\nlaunching a malicious application, Microsoft said. MS16-030 patches two flaws in Windows OLE that\ncould lead to remote code execution, because it too fails to validate user input. \n\nThe remaining bulletins were rated important by Microsoft: \n\n", "polarity": 0.05240545617904109, "subjectivity": 0.4762946173323532, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://threatpost.com/microsoft-mistakenly-leaks-secure-boot-key/119828/", "date": "2016-08-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Mimoso", "title": "Microsoft Mistakenly Leaks Secure Boot Key", "body": "Update\u00a0Opponents of the government\u2019s constant talk about intentional backdoors and exceptional\naccess finally may have their case study as to why it\u2019s such a bad idea. \n\nTwo researchers operating under aliases (my123 and slipstream) this week posted a report\u2014accompanied\nby a relentless chiptune\u2014that reveals how Microsoft inadvertently published a Secure Boot policy\nthat acts as a backdoor that allows for the UEFI firmware feature to be disabled and for anyone to\nload unsigned or self-signed code. \n\nThe gaffe, meant to be a legitimate debugging and testing feature, affects Windows-based devices\nwith Secure Boot on by default; Secure Boot checks that any components loaded during boot are\ndigitally signed (by Microsoft) and verified. As a result of the error, users can run self-signed\nbinaries on affected devices or install non-Windows operating systems. \n\nWorse, the researchers said, is that it\u2019s unlikely Microsoft can clean up this mess. For two months\nrunning, Microsoft has published security bulletins on Patch Tuesday that includes updates to Secure\nBoot. Neither, according to my123 and slipstream, has fully addressed this issue. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be impossible in practise for MS to revoke every bootmgr earlier than a certain point, as\nthey\u2019d break install media, recovery partitions, backups, etc,\u201d the researchers wrote in their\nreport. \n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. \n\n\u201cThe jailbreak technique described in the researchers\u2019 report on August 10 does not apply to desktop\nor enterprise PC systems. It requires physical access and administrator rights to ARM and RT devices\nand does not compromise encryption protections,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost via email. \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s first pass at fixing this in June, MS16-094, blacklisted most, but not all of the\nrelevant policies, the researchers said. An attacker would still be able to manipulate bootmgr,\nwhich manages boot sequences in Windows, in order to bypass Secure Boot. The second patch, released\nthis week in MS16-100, says it revokes bootmgrs, and updates the Secure Boot dbx, which includes the\naddition of new SHA256 hashes. The researchers, however, said this patch may not be complete as\nwell. \n\n\u201cI checked the hash in the signature of several bootmgrs of several architectures against this list,\nand found no matches,\u201d slipstream said. \u201cSo either this revokes many \u2018obscure\u2019 bootmgrs and\nbootmgfws, or I\u2019m checking the wrong hash.\u201d \n\nWith the policy now available online, Windows devices, including Windows RT, HoloLens, Windows\nPhone, maybe Surface Hub, the researchers said, can have their versions of Secure Boot disabled. \n\n\u201cA backdoor, which MS put in to secure boot because they decided to not let the user turn it off in\ncertain devices, allows for secure boot to be disabled everywhere! You can see the irony,\u201d the\nresearchers wrote. \u201cAlso the irony in that MS themselves provided us several nice \u2018golden keys\u2019 (as\nthe FBI would say) for us to use for that purpose :)\u201d \n\nThe irony is not lost on anyone who was watching the Apple-FBI saga from early this year during\nwhich the government asked Apple to create an intentionally weakened version of iOS that would\ndisable or bypass existing protections on a terrorist\u2019s iPhone that would wipe the phone after\nx-number of missed passcode guesses. \n\nApple fought the FBI in court, challenging the constitutionality of the government\u2019s demand, which\nwas eventually dropped after the FBI found an unnamed third-party who could crack the phone. \n\nThe Secure Boot report calls out the FBI specifically. \n\n\u201cAbout the FBI: are you reading this? If you are, then this is a perfect real world example about\nwhy your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a \u2018secure golden key\u2019 is very bad!,\u201d the researchers\nwrote. \u201cSmarter people than me have been telling this to you for so long, it seems you have your\nfingers in your ears. You seriously don\u2019t understand still? Microsoft implemented a \u2018secure golden\nkey\u2019 system. And the golden keys got released from MS own stupidity.

Windows 10 continues to have the\nhighest satisfaction of any version of Windows.\u201d \n\nOriginally, Microsoft pushed the Windows 10 upgrade app via its Windows Update system. Users who\nreceived the app had a Windows 10 upgrade icon placed in their system tray that doubled as a way to\ninitiate the OS upgrade download as well as offering an advertisement that boasted new Windows 10\nfeatures. \n\nOver time Microsoft became more aggressive, according to the EFF, bundling Windows 10 ads as part of\nan Internet Explorer security patch. Also criticized was the fact in many instances Microsoft didn\u2019t\njust download the Windows 10 upgrade app, but also downloaded the entire required Windows 10\ninstallation files (4GB). \n\nBut the EFF maintains on May 2016 Microsoft crossed a line when it changed the expected behavior of\na dialog prompt used in a window tied to the Windows 10 upgrade app. \u201cSpecifically, when prompted\nwith a Windows 10 update, if the user chose to decline it by hitting the \u2018X\u2019 in the upper right hand\ncorner, Microsoft interpreted that as consent to download Windows 10,\u201d Kalia wrote. \n\nThe EFF also asserts that with the introduction of the Cortana digital assistant, a feature\nintroduced with Windows 10, Microsoft demonstrated another disturbing behavior pattern and\ndisregarded user privacy under the guise of Cortana customization. \n\n\u201cWindows 10 sends an unprecedented amount of usage data back to Microsoft,\u201d Kalia\nmaintains,\u00a0including location data, text input, voice input, touch input, webpages you visit, and\ntelemetry data regarding your general usage of your computer, including which programs you run and\nfor how long. \n\nOf course users can disable data sharing features that limit the amount of personal information\nMicrosoft collects. However, the EFF says even those who opt out of sharing data within Windows 10\nstill can\u2019t escape sharing some data with Microsoft via the operating system\u2019s telemetry reporting. \n\nWindows 10 telemetry, also known as the Universal Telemetry Client (UTC), is \u201csystem data that is\nuploaded by the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component.\u201d Information shared with\nMicrosoft via UTC includes system uptime and crash data and hardware attributes such as CPU,\ninstalled memory, and storage, according to Windows experts Ed Bott who has written extensively\nabout Windows 10 telemetry. \n\nUTC can collect personal data as part of a crash report when specific files are the cause of the\nsystem failure. Users of Windows 10 Enterprise Edition can turn telemetry data sharing off, but Home\nand Pro users can\u2019t, the EFF maintains. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Windows 10 has some great security improvements over previous versions of the\noperating system. But it\u2019s a shame that Microsoft made users choose between having privacy and\nsecurity,\u201d Kalia said. \n\n", "polarity": 0.026425403864428255, "subjectivity": 0.4287350860521594, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/critical-security-updates-from-adobe-microsoft/", "date": "2017-04-12T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Critical Security Updates from Adobe, Microsoft", "body": "Adobe and Microsoft separately issued updates on Tuesday to fix a slew of security flaws in their\nproducts. Adobe patched dozens of holes in its Flash Player, Acrobat and Reader products. Microsoft\npushed fixes to address dozens of vulnerabilities in Windows and related software.\n\nThe biggest change this month for Windows users and specifically for people responsible for\nmaintaining lots of Windows machines is that Microsoft has replaced individual security bulletins\nfor patches\u00a0with a single \u201cSecurity Update Guide.\u201d\n\nThis change follows closely on the heels of a move by Microsoft to bar home users from selectively\ndownloading specific updates and instead issuing all monthly updates as one big patch blob.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s\u00a0claims that customers have been clamoring for this consolidated guide notwithstanding,\nmany users are likely to be put off by the new format, which seems to require a great deal more\nclicking and searching than under the previous rubric. In any case, Microsoft has released a FAQ\nexplaining what\u2019s changed and what folks can expect under the new arrangement.\n\nBy my count, Microsoft\u2019s patches this week address some\u00a046 security vulnerabilities, including flaws\nin Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Windows, Office, Visual Studio for Mac, .NET Framework,\nSilverlight and Adobe Flash Player.\n\nAt least two of the critical bugs fixed by Microsoft this month are already being exploited in\nactive attacks, including a weakness in Microsoft Word that is showing up in attacks designed to\nspread the Dridex banking trojan.\n\nFinally, a heads up for any Microsoft users still running Windows Vista: This month is slated to be\nthe last that Vista will receive security updates. Vista was first released to consumers more than\nten years ago \u2014 in January 2007 \u2014 so if you\u2019re still using Vista it might be time to give a more\nmodern OS a try (doesn\u2019t have to be Windows\u2026just saying).\n\nAs it is wont to do on Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Adobe pushed its own batch of security patches.\nThe usual \u201ccritical\u201d update for Flash Player fixes at least seven flaws. The newest version is v.\n25.0.0.148\u00a0for Windows, Mac and Linux systems.\n\nAs loyal readers here no doubt already know, I dislike Flash because it\u2019s full of security holes, is\na favorite target of drive-by malware exploits, and isn\u2019t really necessary to be left installed or\nturned on all the time anymore.\n\nHence, if you have Flash installed,\u00a0you should update, hobble or remove Flash as soon as possible.\nTo see which version of Flash your browser may have installed, check out this page.\n\nThe smartest option is probably to ditch the program once and for all and significantly increase the\nsecurity of your system in the process. An extremely powerful and buggy program that binds itself to\nthe browser, Flash is a favorite target of attackers and malware. For some ideas about how to hobble\nor do without Flash\u00a0(as well as slightly less radical\u00a0solutions) check out\u00a0A Month Without Adobe\nFlash Player.\n\nIf you choose to keep Flash, please update it today.\u00a0The most recent versions of Flash should be\navailable from\u00a0the Flash home page. Windows users who browse the Web with anything other than\nInternet Explorer may need to apply this patch twice, once with IE and again using the alternative\nbrowser (Firefox, Opera, e.g.).\n\nChrome\u00a0and IE should auto-install the latest Flash version on browser restart (users may need to\nmanually check for updates in and/or restart the browser to get the latest Flash version).

The\nReader/Acrobat updates address a whopping 47 security holes in these products, so if you\u2019ve got\neither program installed please take a moment to update.\n\nAs ever, please leave a note in the comment section if you run into any difficulties downloading or\ninstalling any of these patches.\n\n", "polarity": 0.1740349927849928, "subjectivity": 0.5260574494949494, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/adobe-microsoft-push-critical-security-fixes-10/", "date": "2017-03-14T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Adobe, Microsoft Push Critical Security Fixes", "body": "Adobe and Microsoft each pushed out security updates for their products today.

CERT warned that exploit code for the\nflaw was already available online.\n\nThe updates from Adobe fix at least 13 vulnerabilities in versions of Flash Player for Windows, Mac,\nChromeOS and Linux systems. Adobe said it is not aware of any exploits in the wild for any of the 13\nflaws fixed in this update.\n\nThe latest update brings Flash to v. 24.0.0.221.

Also notable this month is that Microsoft is\nchanging how it deploys security updates, removing the ability for Windows users to pick and choose\nwhich individual patches to install.\n\nZero-day vulnerabilities describe flaws that even the makers of the targeted software don\u2019t know\nabout before they start seeing the flaws exploited in the wild, meaning the vendor has \u201czero days\u201d\nto fix the bugs.\n\nAccording to security vendor Qualys, Patch Tuesday updates fix zero-day bugs in Internet Explorer\nand Edge\u00a0\u2014 the default browsers on different versions of Windows. MS16-121 addresses a\u00a0zero-day in\nMicrosoft Office. Another zero-day flaw affects\u00a0GDI+ \u2014 a graphics component built into Windows that\ncan be exploitable through the browser. The final zero-day is present in the Internet Messaging\ncomponent of Windows.\n\nStarting this month, home and business Windows users will no longer be able to pick and choose which\nupdates to install and which to leave for another time. For example, I\u2019ve often advised home users\nto hold off on installing .NET updates until all other patches for the month are applied \u2014 reasoning\nthat .NET updates are very large and in my experience have frequently been found to be the source of\nproblems when applying huge numbers of patches simultaneously.\n\nBut that cafeteria-style patching goes out the\u2026err\u2026Windows with this month\u2019s release. Microsoft made\nthe announcement in May of this year and revisited the subject again in August to add more detail\nbehind its decision:\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s patch policy changes are slightly different for home versus business customers.\nConsumers on Windows 7 Service Pack 1 and Windows 8.1 will henceforth receive what Redmond is\ncalling a \u201cMonthly Rollup,\u201d which addresses both security issues and reliability issues in a single\nupdate. The \u201cSecurity-only updates\u201d option \u2014 intended for enterprises and not available via Windows\nUpdate \u2014 \u00a0will only include new security patches that are released for that month.\n\nWhat this means is that if any part of the patch bundle breaks, the only option is to remove the\nentire bundle (instead of the offending patch, as was previously possible). I have no doubt this\nsimplifies things for Microsoft and likely saves them a ton of money, but my concern is this will\nleave end-users unable to apply critical patches simply due to a single patch breaking something.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that several update types won\u2019t be included in a rollup, including those for\nAdobe Flash Player. As it happens,\u00a0Adobe today issued an update for its Flash Player browser plugin\nthat fixes a dozen security vulnerabilities in the program. The company said it is currently not\naware of any attempts to exploit these flaws in the wild (i.e., no zero-days in this month\u2019s Flash\npatch).\n\nThe latest update brings Flash to v. 23.0.0.185\u00a0for Windows and Mac users alike.

As always, if you experience any issues downloading or installing any of the\nMicrosoft updates from this month, please don\u2019t hesitate to leave a comment below.\n\nFor more information on these and other Microsoft security updates released today, check out the\nblogs at security vendors Qualys and\u00a0Shavlik.\n\n", "polarity": -0.031314699792960664, "subjectivity": 0.5076604554865424, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/adobe-microsoft-patch-critical-security-bugs/", "date": "2016-07-13T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Adobe, Microsoft Patch Critical Security Bugs", "body": "Adobe has\u00a0pushed out a critical update to plug at least 52 security holes in its widely-used Flash\nPlayer browser plugin, and another update to patch holes in Adobe Reader. Separately, Microsoft\nreleased 11 security updates to fix vulnerabilities more than 40 flaws in Windows and related\nsoftware.\n\nFirst off, if you have Adobe Flash Player installed and haven\u2019t yet hobbled this insecure program so\nthat it runs only when you want it to, you are playing with fire. It\u2019s bad enough that hackers are\nconstantly finding and exploiting zero-day flaws in Flash Player before Adobe even knows about the\nbugs.\n\nThe bigger issue is that Flash is an extremely powerful program that\u00a0runs inside the browser, which\nmeans users can compromise their computer just by browsing to a hacked or malicious site that\ntargets unpatched Flash flaws.\n\nThe smartest option is probably to ditch this insecure program once and for all and significantly\nincrease the security of your system in the process. I\u2019ve got more on that approach \u2014 as well as\nslightly less radical solutions \u2014 in A Month Without Adobe Flash Player.\n\nIf you choose to update, please do it today. The most recent versions of Flash should be available\nfrom this Flash distribution page or the Flash home page. Windows users who browse the Web with\nanything other than Internet Explorer may need to apply this patch twice, once with IE and again\nusing the alternative browser (Firefox, Opera, e.g.). Chrome and IE should auto-install the latest\nFlash version on browser restart.\n\nHappily, Adobe has delayed plans to stop distributing direct download links to its Flash Player\nprogram. The company had said it would decommission the direct download page on June 30, 2016, but\nthe latest, patched Flash version 22.0.0.209 for Windows and Mac systems is still available there.\nThe wording on the site has been changed to indicate the download links will be decommissioned\n\u201csoon.\u201d\n\nAdobe\u2019s advisory on the Flash flaws is here. The company also released a security update that\naddresses at least 30 security holes in Adobe Reader. The latest version of Reader for most Windows\nand Mac users is v.\u00a015.017.20050.\n\nSix of the 11 patches Microsoft issued this month earned its most dire \u201ccritical\u201d rating, which\nMicrosoft assigns to software bugs that can be exploited to remotely commandeer vulnerable machines\nwith little to no help from users, save from perhaps browsing to a hacked or malicious site.\n\nIn fact, most of the vulnerabilities Microsoft fixed this Patch Tuesday\u00a0are in the company\u2019s Web\nbrowsers \u2014 i.e., Internet Explorer (15 vulnerabilities) and its newer Edge browser (13 flaws).\u00a0Both\npatches address numerous browse-and-get-owned issues.\n\nAnother critical patch from Redmond tackles problems in Microsoft Office that could be exploited\nthrough poisoned Office documents.\n\nFor\u00a0further breakdown on the patches this month from Adobe and Microsoft, check out these blog posts\nfrom security vendors Qualys and Shavlik.

Wi-Fi\nSense, if enabled, will continue to get you connected to open Wi-Fi hotspots that it knows about\nthrough crowdsourcing.\u201d\n\nWi-Fi Sense\u00a0doesn\u2019t share your WiFi network password per se \u2014 it shares an encrypted version of that\npassword. But it does allow anyone in your Skype or Outlook or\u00a0Hotmail contacts lists to waltz onto\nyour Wi-Fi network \u2014 should they ever wander within range of it or visit your home (or hop onto it\nsecretly from hundreds of yards away with a good \u2018ole cantenna!).\n\nWhen the feature first launched, Microsoft sought\u00a0to reassure would-be Windows 10 users that their\nWi-Fi password would be sent encrypted and stored encrypted \u2014 on a Microsoft server. The company\nalso pointed out that Windows 10 users had to initially agree to share their network during the\nWindows 10 installation process before the feature would be turned on.\n\nBut these assurances rang hollow for many Windows users already suspicious about a feature that\ncould share access to a user\u2019s wireless network even after that user changed their\u00a0Wi-Fi network\npassword.\n\n\u201cAnnoyingly, because they didn\u2019t have your actual password, just authorization to ask the Wi-Fi\nSense service to supply it on their behalf, changing your password down the line wouldn\u2019t keep them\nout \u2013 Wi-Fi Sense would learn the new password directly from you and supply it for them in future,\u201d\nJohn Zorabedian wrote for security firm Sophos.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s solution for those\u00a0concerned\u00a0required users to change the name (a.k.a. \u201cSSID\u201c) of their\nWi-Fi network to include the text \u201c_optout\u201d somewhere in the network name (for example,\n\u201coldnetworknamehere_optout\u201d).\n\nI commend Microsoft for taking this step, if albeit belatedly.

Microsoft meanwhile today released 16 update bundles to address dozens of security flaws in\nWindows, Internet Explorer and related software.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s patch batch includes updates for \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities (flaws that attackers figure\nout how to exploit before before the software maker does) in Internet Explorer (IE) and in Windows.\nHalf of the 16 patches that Redmond issued today earned its \u201ccritical\u201d rating, meaning the\nvulnerabilities could be exploited remotely through no help from the user, save for perhaps clicking\na link, opening a file or visiting a hacked or malicious Web site.\n\nAccording to security firm Shavlik, two of the Microsoft patches tackle issues that were publicly\ndisclosed prior to today\u2019s updates, including bugs in IE and the Microsoft .NET Framework.\n\nAnytime there\u2019s a .NET Framework update available, I always uncheck those updates to install and\nthen reboot and install the .NET updates; I\u2019ve had too many .NET update failures muddy the process\nof figuring out which update borked a Windows machine after a batch of patches to do otherwise, but\nyour mileage may vary.\n\nOn the Adobe side, the pending Flash update fixes a single vulnerability that apparently is already\nbeing exploited in active attacks online. However, Shavlik says there appears to be some confusion\nabout how many bugs are fixed in the Flash update.\n\n\u201cIf information gleaned from [Microsoft\u2019s account of the Flash Player update]\u00a0MS16-064 is accurate,\nthis Zero Day will be accompanied by 23 additional CVEs, with the release expected on May 12th,\u201d\nShavlik wrote.\u00a0\u201cWith this in mind, the recommendation is to roll this update out immediately.\u201d\n\nAdobe says the vulnerability is included in Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.226 and earlier versions for\nWindows, Macintosh, Linux, and Chrome OS, and that the flaw will be fixed in a version of Flash to\nbe released May 12.\n\nAs far as Flash is concerned, the smartest option is probably best to hobble or ditch the program\nonce and for all \u2014 and significantly increase the security of your system in the process. I\u2019ve got\nmore on that approach (as well as slightly less radical\u00a0solutions ) in A Month Without Adobe Flash\nPlayer.\n\nIf you use Adobe Reader to display PDF documents, you\u2019ll need to update that, too. Alternatively,\nconsider switching to another reader that is perhaps less targeted. Adobe Reader comes bundled with\na number of third-party software products, but many Windows users may not realize there are\nalternatives, including some good free ones. For a time I\u00a0used Foxit Reader, but that program seems\nto have grown more bloated with each release. My current preference is\u00a0Sumatra PDF; it is\nlightweight (about 40 times smaller than Adobe Reader) and quite fast.\n\nFinally, if you run a Web site that in any way relies on Adobe\u2019s Cold Fusion technology, please\nupdate your software soon.

Also, Adobe updated its Flash Player release to\naddress at least two-dozen flaws \u2014 in addition to the zero-day vulnerability Adobe patched last\nweek.\n\nThe Windows patch that seems to be getting the most attention this month remedies seven\nvulnerabilities in Samba, a service used to manage file and print services across networks and\nmultiple operating systems. This may sound innocuous enough, but attackers who gain access to\nprivate or\u00a0corporate network could use these flaws to intercept traffic, view or modify user\npasswords, or shut down critical services.\n\nAccording to badlock.org, a Web site set up to disseminate information about the widespread nature\nof the threat that this vulnerability poses, we are likely to see active exploitation of the Samba\nvulnerabilities soon.\n\nTwo of the Microsoft patches address flaws that were disclosed prior to Patch Tuesday. One of them\nis included in a bundle of fixes for Internet Explorer. A critical update for the Microsoft Graphics\nComponent targets four vulnerabilities, two of which have been detected already in exploits in the\nwild, according to Chris Goettl at security vendor Shavlik.\n\nJust a reminder: If you use Windows and haven\u2019t yet taken advantage of the Enhanced Mitigation\nExperience Toolkit, a.k.a. \u201cEMET,\u201d you should definitely consider it. I describe the basic features\nand benefits of running EMET in this blog post from 2014 (yes, it\u2019s time to revisit EMET in a future\npost), but the gist of it is that EMET helps block or blunt exploits against known and unknown\nWindows vulnerabilities and flaws in third-party applications that run on top of Windows. The latest\nversion, v. 5.5, is available here.\n\nOn Friday, Adobe released an emergency update for Flash Player to fix a vulnerability that is being\nactively exploited in the wild and used to foist malware (such as ransomware). Adobe updated its\nadvisory for that release to include fixes for 23 additional flaws.\n\nAs I noted in last week\u2019s piece on the emergency Flash Patch, most users are better off hobbling or\nremoving Flash altogether.\u00a0I\u2019ve got more on that approach (as well as slightly less radical\nsolutions ) in A Month Without Adobe Flash Player.\n\nIf you choose to update, please do it today.

As security firm Shavlik notes, Microsoft\u2019s\nclaim that Edge is more secure than IE seems to be holding out, albeit not by much.

Adobe released a patch that fixes a whopping 78 security vulnerabilities in its\nFlash Player software.

What\u2019s more, two of the vulnerabilities are actively\nbeing exploited, including a bug in Windows and Microsoft Office.\n\nAs per usual,\u00a0a patch for Internet Explorer addresses a huge chunk (30) of the individual security\nflaws tackled in this month\u2019s update cycle. Microsoft also released a critical patch to correct 15\nweaknesses in Microsoft Edge, the browser meant to supplant IE.\n\nAccording to security firm Shavlik, supported versions of IE\u00a0will be changing quite a bit in\nJanuary. After\u00a0January 12, 2016, only the latest IE version available on each\u00a0operating system will\nbe supported. This means if you are not running\u00a0the latest version of IE available for the version\nof Windows you are\u00a0on, you will no longer be getting security updates. More information about this\nchange is available here.\n\nThe SANS Internet Storm Center is reporting that some Windows users who have Outlook installed are\nexperiencing some difficulties using the program after applying this month\u2019s updates. If you use\nOutlook, it may be wise to put off installing this patch for a few days until Microsoft addresses\nthe issue.\n\nAnother vulnerability \u2014 fixed by a patch for domain name system (DNS) servers that run on Windows\nServers \u2014 could prove extremely dangerous for organizations that rely on Windows Server for DNS\nservices. According to SANS,\u00a0Microsoft rates the exploitability as \u201c2\u201d, but doesn\u2019t provide much\ndetails as to the nature of the vulnerability other than the fact that it can be triggered by remote\nDNS requests, which is bad news if you are using a Microsoft DNS server exposed to the public\ninternet.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Flash update brings Flash to version 20.0.0.228 for Internet Explorer and Chrome on Windows\nand Mac systems, and 20.0.0.235 for Windows and Mac versions of Firefox and Safari.\n\nAs I noted in a previous post, most users can jump off the incessant Flash-patching merry-go-round\nby simply removing the program \u2014 or hobbling it until and unless it is needed for some purpose or\nsite.\n\nDisabling Flash in Chrome is simple enough, and can be easily reversed: On a Windows, Mac, Linux or\nChrome OS installation of Chrome, type \u201cchrome:plugins\u201d into the address bar, and on the Plug-ins\npage look for the \u201cFlash\u201d listing: To disable Flash, click the disable link (to re-enable it, click\n\u201cenable\u201d). Windows users can remove Flash from the Add/Remove Programs panel, or use Adobe\u2019s\nuninstaller for Flash Player.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about removing Flash altogether, consider a dual-browser approach. That is,\nunplugging Flash from the browser you use for everyday surfing, and leaving it plugged in to a\nsecond browser that you only use for sites that require Flash. Another alternative to removing Flash\nis Click-To-Play, which lets you control what Flash (and Java) content gets to load when you visit a\nWeb page.\n\nIf you decide to proceed with Flash and update, the most recent versions of Flash should be\navailable from the Flash home page.

Nevertheless,\u00a0I would recommend that if you use Flash that you strongly\u00a0consider removing\nit, or at least hobbling it until and unless you need it.\n\nUpdate, 4:31 p.m. ET: In case you needed another reason to remove or hobble Flash, Adobe just\nreleased an advisory warning that attackers are exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in this latest\nversion of Flash player. Adobe said it expects to issue another fix for Flash to fix the flaw during\nthe week of Oct. 19.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nDisabling Flash in Chrome is simple enough, and can be easily reversed: On a Windows, Mac, Linux or\nChrome OS installation of Chrome, type \u201cchrome:plugins\u201d into the address bar, and on the Plug-ins\npage look for the \u201cFlash\u201d listing: To disable Flash, click the disable link (to re-enable it, click\n\u201cenable\u201d). Windows users can remove Flash from the Add/Remove Programs panel, or use Adobe\u2019s\nuninstaller for Flash Player.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about removing Flash altogether, consider a dual-browser approach. That is,\nunplugging Flash from the browser you use for everyday surfing, and leaving it plugged in to a\nsecond browser that you only use for sites that require Flash. Another alternative to removing Flash\nis Click-To-Play, which lets you control what Flash content gets to load when you visit a Web page.\n\nIf you decide to proceed with Flash and update, the\u00a0most recent versions of Flash should be\navailable from the Flash home page, but beware potentially unwanted add-ons, like McAfee Security\nScan. To avoid this, uncheck the pre-checked box before downloading, or grab your OS-specific Flash\ndownload from\u00a0here.\u00a0Windows users who browse the Web with anything other than Internet Explorer may\nneed to apply this patch twice, once with IE and again using the alternative browser (Firefox,\nOpera, e.g.).\n\nThere is also a security update available for Adobe AIR. If you use this program, please take a\nmoment today to patch it. AIR should prompt you to update to the latest version if you launch an\napplication the requires AIR, such as Pandora.\n\nFinally, Adobe issued a fairly substantial fix for Adobe Reader and Acrobat that fixes more than\nfour dozen vulnerabilities in these programs.

Included in the batch is a fix for a flaw first\npatched in 2010 \u2014 the very same vulnerability that led to the discovery of the infamous cyberweapon\nknown as Stuxnet. Turns out, the patch that Microsoft shipped to fix that flaw in 2010 didn\u2019t quite\ndo the trick, leaving Windows users dangerously exposed all this time.\n\nOn this, the third Patch Tuesday of 2015, Microsoft pushed 14 update bundles to address at least 43\nseparate vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Exchange, Office and a host of other components.\n\nFive of the\u00a0the patches released today fix flaws that Microsoft has assigned its most serious\n\u201ccritical\u201d label, meaning the vulnerabilities these patches fix can be exploited to compromise\nvulnerable systems through little or no action on the part of the user \u2014 save for perhaps opening a\nbooby-trapped file or visiting a hacked/malicious Web site.\n\nOne of the more curious critical fixes is MS15-020, which according to HP\u2019s Zero Day Initiative\nresearchers addresses the same vulnerability that Microsoft patched in August 2010.\u00a0That\nvulnerability \u2014 first revealed in a post on this blog July 15, 2010 \u2014 was later discovered to have\nbeen one of four zero-day flaws\u00a0used in Stuxnet, a weapon of unprecedented sophistication that is\nnow widely considered to have been a joint U.S. and Israeli project aimed at delaying Iran\u2019s nuclear\nambitions. The folks at HP TippingPoint have published a blog post on their work in uncovering the\nfailed fix, and how the original 2010 patch missed the mark. For more on Stuxnet, check out Kim\nZetter\u2018s excellent new book, Countdown To Zero Day.\n\nTwo other patches address security issues that have received a great deal of media attention of\nlate: The Superfish malware and the FREAK SSL vulnerability. Freak is a flaw that allows an attacker\nwho controls the local network to downgrade your computer\u2019s encrypted communications to a much\nweaker (and crackable) level of security \u2014 potentially allowing attackers to eavesdrop on your\nbrowsing and modify or redirect your communications.\n\nAs security expert and cryptologist Matthew Green noted, the FREAK vulnerability is thought to stem\nfrom efforts by the National Security Agency to weaken encryption technology allowed to be shipped\noverseas. Ironically, several researchers have shown how the NSA\u2019s own Web site was made vulnerable\nby this flaw; check out SmackTLS.com for more on that.\n\nMicrosoft also blogged that on Feb. 19 it released an update to its Malicious Software Removal Tool\nwhich searches for and removes Superfish, an adware program that was recently discovered to have\nfactory-shipped with many consumer PCs made by Lenovo. Superfish also\u00a0has been shown to undermine\nthe SSL encryption on systems with the invasive program installed, as demonstrated by researcher\nRobert Graham in this post. Lenovo has said it is no longer shipping Superfish with PCs, and has\nreleased a tool to help remove the program.\n\nFor the first time in a while, there are no fixes from Adobe on\u00a0Patch Tuesday, although one of the\ncritical patches Microsoft released today addresses a dangerous bug in the Adobe Font Driver on most\nversions of Windows.

The bulk of attacks have been so-called \u201cLayer 7\u201d assaults \u2014\nin that they try to mimic legitimate Web browsing activity in a bid to avoid detection.\n\nBut what\u2019s most interesting about these compromised and/or misconfigured systems is how many of them\nare located at legitimate companies that have been compromised by miscreants. According to Akamai,\nmost of the malicious sources were Windows-based servers powered by Microsoft\u2019s IIS Web server\ntechnology. \u00a0The top five industries where those compromised systems reside are in entertainment,\nbanking, hosting providers, software-as-a-service providers, and consulting services.\n\nMany of those associated with LizardSquad are wannabe hackers with zero skill and a desire to be\nconnected to something interesting and fun. Unfortunately,\u00a0many of the LizardSquad individuals\ninvolved in these attacks also are embroiled in far more serious online crimes \u2014 including identity\ntheft, malware distribution,\u00a0spam and\u00a0credit card fraud. While most of the group\u2019s acolytes are\nknown to U.S. enforcement investigators, many are minors, and the sad truth is that federal\nprosecutors don\u2019t really know what to do with underage felons except to turn them into informants.\nMeanwhile, the cycle of abuse continues.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 30, 7:05 p.m. ET: A previous version of this story named multiple companies suspected\nof hosting compromised systems that may have been abused by LizardSquad members in attacks on this\nblog.

IE10/IE11 on Windows 8.x and\nChrome should auto-update their versions of Flash. If your version of Chrome doesn\u2019t show the latest\nversion of Flash, you may need to restart the browser or manually force Chrome to check for updates\n(click the three-bar icon to the right of the address bar, select \u201cAbout Google Chrome\u201d and it\nshould check then).\n\nThe most recent versions of Flash are available from the Flash home page, but beware potentially\nunwanted add-ons, like McAfee Security Scan. To avoid this, uncheck the pre-checked box before\ndownloading, or grab your OS-specific Flash download from here.\n\nWindows users who browse the Web with anything other than Internet Explorer may need to apply this\npatch twice, once with IE and again using the alternative browser (Firefox, Opera, e.g.).\n\nAdobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader users will need to apply a critical update that fixes at least 20\ncritical security in these programs. See Adobe\u2019s Reader advisory for more details on that. The\nlatest updates live here.\n\n", "polarity": 0.05078849721706865, "subjectivity": 0.6244897959183674, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/microsoft-releases-emergency-security-update/", "date": "2014-11-18T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft Releases Emergency Security Update", "body": "Microsoft today\u00a0deviated from its regular pattern of releasing security updates on the second\nTuesday of each month, pushing out an emergency patch to plug a security hole\u00a0in all supported\nversions of Windows. The company urged Windows users to install the update as quickly as possible,\nnoting that miscreants already are exploiting the weaknesses to launch targeted attacks.\n\nThe update (MS14-068) addresses a bug in a Windows component called Microsoft Windows Kerberos KDC,\nwhich handles authenticating Windows PCs on a local network. It is somewhat less of a problem\u00a0for\nWindows home users (it is only rated critical for server versions of Windows) but it poses a serious\nthreat to organizations. According to security vendor\u00a0Shavlik, the flaw allows an attacker to\nelevate domain user account privileges to those of the domain administrator account.\n\n\u201cThe attacker could forge a Kerberos Ticket and send that to the Kerberos KDC which claims the user\nis a domain administrator,\u201d writes Chris Goettl, product manager with Shavlik. \u201cFrom there the\nattacker can impersonate any domain accounts, add themselves to any group, install programs,\nview\\change\\delete date, or create any new accounts they wish.\u00a0\u00a0This could allow the attacker to\nthen compromise any computer in the domain, including domain controllers.\u00a0\u00a0If there is a silver\nlining in this one it is in the fact that the attacker must have a valid domain user account to\nexploit the vulnerability, but once they have done so, they have the keys to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe patch is one of two that Microsoft had expected to release on Patch Tuesday earlier this month,\nbut unexpectedly pulled at the last moment. \u00a0\u201cThis is pretty severe and definitely explains why\nMicrosoft only delayed the release and did not pull it from the November Patch Tuesday release all\ntogether,\u201d Goettl said.\n\nOn a separate note, security experts are warning those who haven\u2019t yet fully applied the updates\nfrom Patch Tuesday to get on with it already. Researchers with vulnerability exploit development\nfirm Immunity have been detailing their work in devising reliable ways to exploit a critical flaw in\nMicrosoft Secure Channel (a.k.a. \u201cSchannel\u201d), a security package in Windows that handles SSL/TLS\nencryption \u2014 which\u00a0protects the privacy and security of Web browsing for Windows users. More\nimportantly, there are signs that malicious hackers are devising their own methods of exploiting the\nflaw to seize control over unpatched Windows systems.\n\nWolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer at Qualys, said security researchers were immediately\ndriven to this bulletin as it updates Microsoft\u2019s SSL/TLS implementation fixing Remote Code\nExecution and Information Leakage that were found internally at Microsoft during a code audit.\n\n\u201cMore information has not been made available, but in theory this sounds quite similar in scope to\nApril\u2019s Heartbleed problem in OpenSSL, which was widely publicized and had a number of documented\nabuse cases,\u201d Kandek wrote in a blog post today. \u201cThe dark side is certainly making progress in\nfinding an exploit for these vulnerabilities. It is now high time to patch.\u201d\n\n", "polarity": 0.08098868873062422, "subjectivity": 0.5239644226741001, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/adobe-microsoft-issue-critical-security-fixes-3/", "date": "2014-11-11T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Adobe, Microsoft Issue Critical Security Fixes", "body": "Adobe and Microsoft today each issued security updates to fix critical vulnerabilities in their\nsoftware. Microsoft pushed 14 patches to address problems in Windows, Office, Internet Explorer and\n.NET, among other products. Separately, Adobe issued an update for its Flash Player software that\ncorrects at least 18 security issues.\n\nMicrosoft announced 16 bulletins, but curiously two of those are listed as pending. Topping the list\nof critical updates from Microsoft is a fix for a zero-day vulnerability disclosed last month that\nhackers\u00a0have been using in targeted cyber espionage attacks. Another critical patch targets 17\nweaknesses in Internet Explorer, including a remotely exploitable vulnerability in all supported\nversions of Windows that earned a CVSS score of 9.3 (meaning it is highly likely to be exploited in\ndrive-by attacks, and probably soon).\n\nThat flaw is a rare \u201cunicorn-like\u201d bug according to IBM X-Force, which discovered and reported the\nissue privately to Microsoft. In a blog post published today, IBM researchers described how the\nvulnerability can be used to sidestep the Enhanced Protected Mode sandbox in IE11, as well as\nMicrosoft\u2019s EMET anti-exploitation tool that Microsoft offers for free.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the buggy code is at least 19 years old, and has been remotely exploitable for the\npast 18 years,\u201d writes IBM researcher Robert Freeman. \u201cLooking at the original release code of\nWindows 95, the problem is present. In some respects this vulnerability has been sitting in plain\nsight for a long time, despite many other bugs being discovered and patched in the same Windows\nlibrary (OleAut32).\u201d\n\nFreeman said while unpatched Internet Explorer users are most at risk from this bug, the\nvulnerability also could be exploited through Microsoft Office files. \u201cThe other attack vectors this\nvulnerability could work with are Microsoft Office with script macros, for example in Excel\ndocuments,\u201d Freeman told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cMost versions of Office (since about 2003) have macros\ndisabled by default so the user would have to enable them (which can be a fairly mindless YES click\nat the top of the screen). Or if a user is using an old enough version of Office, the macros will be\nenabled by default.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shavlik, the two pending patches,\u00a0MS14-068 and MS14-075, are both listed on the\nbulletin summary page as \u201crelease date to be determined,\u201d which apparently is an anomaly we haven\u2019t\nseen before. \u201cTypically, a pulled patch is removed from the list entirely,\u201d wrote Chris Goettl,\nproduct manager at Shavlik. \u201cThis could mean it may still come this month, but not today. These two\npatches were likely an OS and the Exchange patch based on the advanced notification list,\u201d That is\nat least one less major product admins will need to be concerned about this Patch Tuesday, although\nthe date to be determined could come at any time.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted in previous posts, the few times I\u2019ve experienced troubles after applying Microsoft\nupdates have almost all included a fix for Microsoft\u2019s widely-installed .NET platform. If you have\n.NET installed, it\u2019s probably a good idea to install this one separately after applying the other\nupdates and rebooting.\n\nAdobe\u2019s update addresses a whopping 18 security holes in Flash Player and Adobe AIR. Updates are\navailable for Windows, Mac and Linux versions of Flash. Adobe says Adobe Flash Player users should\nupdate the program to the version 15.0.0.223. To see which version of Flash you have installed,\ncheck this link. IE10/IE11 on Windows 8.x and Chrome should auto-update their versions of Flash.\n\nThe most recent versions of Flash are available from the Flash home page, but beware potentially\nunwanted add-ons, like McAfee Security Scan. To avoid this, uncheck the pre-checked box before\ndownloading, or grab your OS-specific Flash download from here.\n\nWindows users who browse the Web with anything other than Internet Explorer may need to apply this\npatch twice, once with IE and again using the alternative browser (Firefox, Opera, e.g.). If you\nhave Adobe AIR installed, you\u2019ll want to update this program. AIR ships with an auto-update function\nthat should prompt users to update when they start an application that requires it; the newest,\npatched version is v. 15.0.0.356 for Windows, Mac, and Android.\n\n", "polarity": 0.056456043956043964, "subjectivity": 0.47393543956043954, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/microsoft-partner-claims-fuel-support-scams/", "date": "2014-11-14T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "\u2018Microsoft Partner\u2019 Claims Fuel Support Scams", "body": "You can\u2019t make this stuff up: A tech support company based in the United States that outsources its\nwork to India says its brand is being unfairly maligned by \u2014 wait for it\u2026..tech support scammers\nbased in India. In an added twist, the U.S.-based tech support firm acknowledges that the trouble\nmay be related to its admittedly false statements about being a Microsoft Certified Partner \u2014 the\nsame false statements made by most telephone-based tech support scams.\n\nTech support scams are, unfortunately, an extremely common scourge. Most such scams are the\ntelephonic equivalent of rogue antivirus attacks, which try to frighten consumers into purchasing\nworthless security software and services.\u00a0Both types of scams try to make the consumer believe that\nthe caller is\u00a0somehow associated with Microsoft or with a security company, and each caller tries\u00a0to\ncajole or scare\u00a0the consumer into giving up control over his or her PC.\n\nEarlier this month, a reader shared a link to a lengthy Youtube video by freelance journalist Carey\nHolzman, in which Holzman turns the tables on the tech support scammers. During the video, Holzman\nplays\u00a0along and gives the scammer remote control access to a test computer he\u2019s set up specifically\nfor this video. \u00a0The scammer, who speaks with a strong Indian accent but calls himself \u201cSteve\nWilson\u201d from the \u201cMicrosoft technical department,\u201d tries to convince Holzman that he works for a\ncompany that is a legitimate Microsoft support partner.\n\n\u201cLet me show you who we are,\u201d the scammer says, opening up Google.com and typing SB3 Inc. Clicking\non the first result brings up sb3inc[dot]com, which proudly displays an icon in the upper right\ncorner of its home page stating that it is a Microsoft Certified Partner. \u201cThis is our mother\ncompany. Can you see that we are a Microsoft certified partner?\u201d\n\nWhen Holzman replies that this means nothing and that anyone can just put a\u00a0logo\u00a0on their site\nsaying they\u2019re associated with Microsoft, the scammer runs a search on Microsoft.com for SB3. The\nscammer shows true chutzpah when he points to the first result, which \u2014 if clicked \u2014 leads to a page\non Microsoft\u2019s community site where members try to warn the poster away from SB3 as a scam.\n\nWhen Holzman tries to get the scammer to let him load the actual search result link about SB3 on\nMicrosoft.com, the caller closes the browser window and proceeds to enable the SysKey utility on\nWindows, which allows the scammer to set a secret master\u00a0password that must be entered before the\ncomputer will boot into Windows (effectively an attempt at locking Holzman out of his test computer\nif he tries to reboot).\n\nThe video goes on for some time more, but I decided to look more closely at SB3. The Web site\nregistration records for the company state that it is based in New Jersey, and it took less than a\nminute to find the Facebook page of the company\u2019s owner \u2014 a Suvajit \u201cSteve\u201d Basu in Ridgewood, NJ.\nBasu\u2019s Facebook feed has him traveling the world, visiting the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, the\nRyder Cup in 2012, and more recently taking delivery on a brand new Porsche.\n\nLess than 24 hours after reaching out to him on Facebook and by phone, Basu returns my call and says\nhe\u2019s working to get to the bottom of this. Before I let him go, I tell Basu that I can\u2019t find on\nMicrosoft\u2019s Partner Site any evidence to support SB3\u2019s claim that it is a Microsoft Certified\nPartner. Basu explains that while the company at one time was in fact a partner, this stopped being\nthe case \u201ca few months ago.\u201d For its part, Microsoft would only confirm that SB3 is not currently a\nMicrosoft partner of any kind.\n\nBasu explained that Microsoft revoked SB3\u2019s partner status after receiving complaints that customers\nwere being cold-called by SB3 technicians claiming to be associated with Microsoft. \u201cMicrosoft had\ngotten complaints and we took out all references to Microsoft as part of our script,\u201d that the\ncompany gives to tech support callers, Basu said.\n\nAs for why SB3 still falsely claimed to be a Microsoft Partner, Basu said his instructions to take\nthe logo down from the site had apparently been ignored by his site\u2019s administrators.\n\n\u201cThat was a mistake for which we do take the blame and responsibility,\u201d Basu said in a follow-up\nemail. \u201cWe have corrected this immediately on hearing from you and you will no longer find a mention\nof Microsoft on our SB3Inc Website.\u201d\n\nBasu said SB3 is a legitimate company based in the USA which uses off-shore manpower and expertise\nto sell tech support services through its iFixo arm, and that the company never participates in the\nsort of scammy activities depicted in Holzman\u2019s video. Basu maintains that scammers are\nimpersonating the company and taking advantage of its good name, and points to a section of the\nvideo where the scammer loads a payment page at support2urpc[dot]com, suggesting that Support to\nYour PC is the real culprit (the latter company did not return messages seeking comment).\n\n\u201cAfter viewing your video it is obvious to us that one or more persons out there are misusing our\nbrand and good-will,\u201d Basu wrote.\u201dWe feel horrible and feel that along with the unknowing consumers\nwe are also victims. This is corporate identity theft.\u201d\n\nSB3 may well be a legitimate company that is being scammed by the scammers, but if that\u2019s true the\ncompany has done itsself and its reputation no favors by falsely stating it is a Microsoft partner.\nWhat\u2019s more, complaints about tech support scammers claiming to be from SB3 are numerous and date\nback\u00a0more than a year. I find it remarkable that a tech support company with the uncommon\ndistinction of having secured a good name in this line of work would not act more zealously to guard\nthat reputation. Alas, a simple Internet search on the SB3 brand would have alerted the company to\nthese shenanigans.\n\nSB3 has since removed the Microsoft Certified Partner logo from its home page, but the image is\nstill on its server. Running a search on that\u00a0image at\u00a0Tineye.com \u2014 an extremely useful image search\nWeb site \u2014 produces more than 11,700 results. No doubt Microsoft and other scam hunters have used\nthis investigative tool to locate tech support scams, which may explain why support2urpc[dot]com\ndoes not appear to include the same image on its site but instead claims association with sites that\ndo.\n\n", "polarity": 0.08922217914755226, "subjectivity": 0.4641667205100042, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/10/microsoft-adobe-push-critical-security-fixes/", "date": "2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft, Adobe Push Critical Security Fixes", "body": "Adobe,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and Oracle each released updates today to plug critical security holes in their\nproducts.

One\nof the updates addresses a zero-day flaw that reportedly is already being exploited in active cyber\nespionage attacks.\n\nEarlier today, iSight Partners released research on a threat the company has dubbed \u201cSandworm\u201d that\nexploits one of the vulnerabilities being patched today (CVE-2014-4114). iSight said it discovered\nthat Russian hackers have been conducting cyber espionage campaigns using the flaw, which is\napparently present in every supported version of Windows. The New York Times\u00a0carried a story today\nabout the extent of the attacks against this flaw.\n\nIn its advisory on the zero-day vulnerability, Microsoft said the bug could allow remote code\nexecution if a user opens a specially crafted malicious Microsoft Office document. According to\niSight, the flaw was used in targeted email attacks that targeted NATO, Ukrainian and Western\ngovernment organizations, and firms in the energy sector.\n\nMore than half of the other vulnerabilities fixed in this month\u2019s patch batch address flaws in\nInternet Explorer. Additional\u00a0details about the individual Microsoft patches released today is\navailable at this link.\n\nSeparately, Adobe issued its usual round of updates for its Flash Player and AIR products. The\npatches plug at least three distinct security holes in these products. Adobe says it\u2019s not aware of\nany active attacks against these vulnerabilities. Updates are available for Windows, Mac and Linux\nversions of Flash.\n\nAdobe says users of the Adobe Flash Player desktop runtime for Windows and Macintosh should update\nto Adobe Flash Player 15.0.0.189.

Oracle says\u00a022 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable\nwithout authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and\npassword. Java SE 8 updates are available here; the latest version of Java SE 7 is here.\n\nIf you really need and use Java for specific Web sites or applications, take a few minutes to update\nthis software. Updates are available from Java.com or via the Java Control Panel. I don\u2019t have an\ninstallation of Java handy on the machine I\u2019m using to compose this post, but keep in mind that\nupdating via the control panel may auto-select the installation of third-party software, so de-\nselect that if you don\u2019t want the added crapware.\n\nOtherwise, seriously consider removing Java altogether. I\u2019ve long urged end users to junk Java\nunless they have a specific use for it (this advice does not scale for businesses, which often have\nlegacy and custom applications that rely on Java). This widely installed and powerful program is\nriddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants.\n\nIf you have an affirmative use or need for Java, unplug it from the browser unless and until you\u2019re\nat a site that requires it (or at least take advantage of click-to-play). The latest versions of\nJava let users disable Java content in web browsers through the Java Control Panel. Alternatively,\nconsider a dual-browser approach, unplugging Java from the browser you use for everyday surfing, and\nleaving it plugged in to a second browser that you only use for sites that require Java.\n\nFor Java power users \u2014 or for those who are having trouble upgrading or removing a stubborn older\nversion \u2014 I recommend JavaRa, which can assist in repairing or removing Java when other methods fail\n(requires the Microsoft .NET Framework, which also received updates today from Microsoft).\n\n", "polarity": 0.06799149126735334, "subjectivity": 0.4412524257351843, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/critical-fixes-for-adobe-microsoft-software/", "date": "2014-09-09T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Critical Fixes for Adobe, Microsoft Software", "body": "Adobe today released updates to fix at least a dozen critical security problems in its Flash Player\nand AIR software.

Please read the update at the end of this post.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nLast week, Microsoft sent the following notice to IT professionals and others who have signed up to\nreceive email notices of security updates:\n\n\u201cAs of July 1, 2014, due to changing governmental policies concerning the issuance of automated\nelectronic messaging, Microsoft is suspending the use of email notifications that announce the\nfollowing:\u201d\n\n* Security bulletin advance notifications  * Security bulletin summaries  * New security advisories\nand bulletins  * Major and minor revisions to security advisories and bulletins\n\n\u201cIn lieu of email notifications, you can subscribe to one or more of the RSS feeds described on the\nSecurity TechCenter website.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more information, or to sign up for an RSS feed, visit the Microsoft Technical Security\nNotifications webpage at http://technet.microsoft.com/security/dd252948.\u201d\n\nAsked about the reason for the change, a Microsoft spokesperson said email communication was\nsuspended to comply with a new Canadian anti-spam law that takes effect on July 1, 2014.\n\nSome anti-spam experts who worked very closely on Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law (CASL) say they are baffled\nby Microsoft\u2019s response to a law which has been almost a decade in the making.\n\nNeil Schwartzman, executive director of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email (CAUCE),\nsaid CASL contains carve-outs for warranty and product safety and security alerts that would more\nthan adequately exempt the Microsoft missives from the regulation.\n\nIndeed, an exception in the law says it does not apply to commercial electronic messages that solely\nprovide\u00a0\u201cwarranty information, product recall information or safety or security information about a\nproduct, goods or a service that the person to whom the message is sent uses, has used or has\npurchased.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am at a complete and total loss to understand how the people in Redmond made such an apparently\npanicked decision,\u201d Schwartzman said,\u201d noting that Microsoft was closely involved in the discussions\nin the Canadian parliament over the bill\u2019s trajectory and content. \u201cThis is the first company I know\nof that\u2019s been that dumb.\u201d\n\nSchwartzman said\u00a0many companies have used CASL as an excuse to freshen up their email lists and to\nre-engage their customers. Some have even gone so far as to enter\u00a0respondents who verify that they\nstill want to receive email communications from a company into drawings for cash prizes and other\ngiveaways.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve seen nothing but a steady stream of reconfirmation mails from\nvarious companies,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m now in the running for several $500 dollar gift certificates\nbecause I confirmed my email. And at the bottom of each of these messages is a note that says\n\u2018please ignore this offer if you\u2019re not Canadian.'\u201d\n\nCAUCE board member Jeff Williams, a former group program manager at Microsoft\u2019s Malware Protection\nCenter, chalked Microsoft\u2019s decision up to a little more than a tough call.\n\n\u201cI can imagine the discussion and wondering among the lawyers and [Microsoft] whether they should\ntry to get hundreds of millions of opt-ins before\u00a0June 30\u00a0or if they should change the way they\nshare info,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but I wouldn\u2019t call it\nan overreaction.\u201d\n\nIn addition to pushing notices about new updates out via\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s RSS feeds, the company also\nappears to be making the security email alerts available to users who have Live, Outlook or Hotmail\naccounts with Microsoft. And of course, readers can continue to rely on KrebsOnSecurity to feature\ninformation on any new security updates available from Microsoft, including each Patch Tuesday\nbundle as well as emergency, \u201cout-of-band\u201d updates released to address zero-day security threats.\n\nUpdate, 5:40 p.m. ET: In an apparent reversal of its decision, Microsoft now says it will be re-\nstarting its security notifications via email early next month. From a Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson: \u201cOn\nJune 27, 2014, Microsoft notified customers that we were suspending Microsoft Security Notifications\ndue to changing governmental policies concerning the issuance of automated electronic messaging. We\nhave reviewed our processes and will resume these security notifications with our monthly Advanced\nNotification Service (ANS) on\u00a0July 3, 2014.\u201d\n\n", "polarity": 0.10522956841138663, "subjectivity": 0.3879734407007134, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/07/microsoft-darkens-4mm-sites-in-malware-fight/", "date": "2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft Darkens 4MM Sites in Malware Fight", "body": "Millions of Web sites were\u00a0shuttered\u00a0Monday morning after\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0executed a\u00a0legal sneak attack\nagainst a malware network thought to be responsible for more than 7.4 million infections of Windows\nPCs worldwide.\n\nIn its latest bid to harness the power of the U.S. legal system to combat malicious software and\ncybercrooks, Microsoft convinced a Nevada court to grant the software giant authority over nearly\ntwo dozen\u00a0domains belonging to no-ip.com, a company that provides dynamic domain name services.\n\nDynamic DNS services are used to map domain names to numeric Internet address that may change\nfrequently. Typically, the biggest users of dynamic DNS services are home Internet users who wish to\nhave a domain name that will always point back to their home computer, no matter how many times\ntheir ISP changes the numeric Internet address assigned to that computer.\n\nIn this case, however, the attackers responsible for leveraging two malware families \u2014 remote-access\nTrojans known as \u201cnjrat\u201d and \u201cnjw0rm\u201d \u2014 were using\u00a0no-ip.com\u2019s services to guarantee that PCs they\ninfected would always be able to reach the Internet servers.\n\nMicrosoft told the court that miscreants who were using these two malware strains were leveraging\nmore than 18,400 hostnames that belonged to no-ip.com. On June 26, the court granted Microsoft the\nauthority to temporarily seize control over 23 domains owned by no-ip.com \u2014 essentially all of the\ndomains that power no-ip.com\u2019s free dynamic DNS services.\n\nMicrosoft was supposed to filter out the traffic flowing to and from those 18,400+ hostnames, and\nallow the remaining, harmless traffic to flow through to its rightful destination. But according to\nno-ip.com marketing manager Natalie Goguen, that\u2019s not at all what happened.\n\n\u201cThey made comments that they\u2019d only taken down bad hostnames and were supposedly redirecting all\ngood traffic through to users, but it\u2019s not happening, and they\u2019re not able to handle our traffic\nvolumes,\u201d Goguen said. \u201cMany legitimate users that use our services have been down all day.\u201d\n\nGoguen said while Microsoft claimed that there were more than 18,000 malicious hostnames involved,\nno-ip.com could only find a little more than 2,000 from that list that were still active as of\nMonday morning.\u00a0Meanwhile, some four million hostnames remain offline, with customer support\nrequests piling up.\n\n\u201cSo, to go after 2,000 or so bad sites, [Microsoft] has taken down four million,\u201d Goguen said.\n\nMicrosoft told the Nevada court that despite numerous reports released by Internet security firms\nover the past year about large volumes of malicious activity emanating from no-ip.com\u2019s service, the\ncompany \u201cconsistently\u00a0failed to take sufficient steps to correct, remedy, or prevent the abuse and\nto keep its domains free from malicious activity.\u201d\n\nBut according to Goguen, the first time Microsoft brought its concerns to no-ip.com was at 7 a.m. on\nJune 30, when the company\u2019s CEO received a knock on the door of his family home and was served with\na copy of the court order granting Microsoft authority over the 23 no-ip.com domains.\n\n\u201cWe work with law enforcement all the time, and our abuse department responds to abuse requests\nwithin 24 hours,\u201d Goguen said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that Microsoft had to take such extreme measures to\ngo about this.\u201d\n\nGoguen isn\u2019t the only one who believes Microsoft swatted a fly with the equivalent of an atom bomb.\nSome of Microsoft\u2019s previous legal sneak attacks targeted \u201cbulletproof\u201d hosting providers \u2014 those\nthat promise to keep sketchy (and high-paying) customers online despite pressure from security firms\nand law enforcement. But according to Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of security firm CrowdStrike,\ntreating no-ip.com like one of these shady providers is a mistake.\n\n\u201cThey have always been very responsive to security researchers and law enforcement,\u201d Alperovitch\nsaid of no-ip.com. \u201cI do not consider them a bullet-proof or abuse-proof host.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Goguen said no-ip.com is considering its legal options for responding to the outage and\nto Microsoft\u2019s allegations that the company somehow turns a blind eye to abuse complaints.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re speaking with our lawyers about this, but right now we\u2019re doing everything we can to fix\nthis, and we need our users to understand that.\u201d\n\nIn tandem with the action against no-ip.com, Microsoft also named and accused two men \u2014 software\ndevelopers thought to reside in Kuwait and Algeria \u2014 of authoring and selling the njrat and njw0rm.\n\nThe complaint against no-ip, the accused malware authors, and the rest of Microsoft\u2019s various legal\nfilings in this case are available at this link.\n\n", "polarity": 0.0707614942528736, "subjectivity": 0.4952175697865352, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/07/microsoft-adobe-push-critical-fixes/", "date": "2014-07-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft, Adobe Push Critical Fixes", "body": "If you use Microsoft products or Adobe Flash Player, please take a moment to read this post and\nupdate your software.

Researchers who go the extra mile and can also demonstrate a way to block the new attack\nmethod they\u2019ve reported can earn an extra $50,000.\n\nThe bug bounty program is a remarkable shift for a company that has for the most part eschewed\npaying researchers for finding security vulnerabilities in its products. But unlike tech giants like\nFacebook, Google, Mozilla and Twitter \u2014 which have for some time now offered bounties ranging from a\nfew hundred to several thousand dollars to researchers who report bugs in their products or Web\nproperties \u2014 Microsoft is reserving its reward money for research on products that are still in\nbeta.\n\nThe reward program \u2014 which officially launches June 26, 2013 \u2014 will pay up to $100,000 USD for\n\u201ctruly novel exploitation techniques\u201d against protections built into the latest version of Windows\n\u2014 Windows 8.1 Preview. Additionally, Microsoft will pay up to $50,000 USD for defensive ideas that\naccompany a qualifying mitigation bypass submission,\u201d the company said in a blog post today.\n\nThese two offers are open-ended, but for just 30 days beginning June 26, Microsoft is offering a\nseparate bounty of up to $11,000 for critical flaws in Internet Explorer 11 Preview on the latest\nversion of Windows (Windows 8.1 Preview).\n\nOn Monday, I asked Mike Reavey, director of Microsoft\u2019s Security Response Center, whether the\ncompany was concerned that restricting the offering to beta products might be perceived as a\npromotional gimmick for Windows 8, which has registered flagging sales and mixed reviews. Reavey\nsaid the research gleaned from the bug bounty program may well turn out to be useful in hardening\nolder versions of Windows and IE, but in any case the company was focused on fixing big security\nissues before releasing these products for broader use.\n\n\u201cThese are unique programs, because you don\u2019t see white-market vulnerability brokers incentivizing\nresearch on products before they\u2019re released,\u201d Reavey said, referring to bug bounty programs run by\ncompanies like iDefense and HP Tipping Point, which pay researchers for critical bugs in third-party\nsoftware and then work with vendors (including Microsoft) to help fix the problems.\n\nVulnerability researchers have long dug through beta versions of Microsoft products, only to sit on\ntheir findings until the product is officially released. That\u2019s because vulnerability brokers don\u2019t\ntypically pay for bugs in beta versions of popular software. But by tying its offer of up to $11,000\nto a 30-day preview window only, Microsoft removes the incentive for researchers to hold onto their\nfindings, said Jeremiah Grossman, chief technology officer for WhiteHat Security Inc.\n\n\u201cWhen any IE preview edition comes out, researchers will start pounding on it looking for bugs, but\nsince bug brokers don\u2019t pay for preview vulnerabilities the researchers have to hold on to their\nbugs and hope that they\u2019re still there when the product is finally released,\u201d Grossman said.\n\u201cMicrosoft really is targeting that window of time with this offering.\u201d\n\nCharlie Miller, a former analyst at the National Security Agency and a security researcher who has\nfound his share of bugs in big name software -most notably Apple\u2019s products), applauded Microsoft\nfor trying to fix flaws in software before most customers start using it.\n\n\u201cThe whole industry has evolved over the past few years, so there\u2019s now less of a focus on finding\nand fixing bugs and more of a focus on making exploitation of bugs more difficult,\u201d said Miller, now\na security engineer at Twitter. \u201cMost people don\u2019t care about software betas, and Microsoft is\ntrying to change that, and I think that\u2019s good.

That\u2019s because Microsoft convinced a judge at the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia\u00a0to give it control over the infrastructure\nthat Bamital used to coordinate the search hijacking activities of host PCs.\n\nOn Wednesday, technicians working on behalf of both Microsoft and Symantec raided data centers\u00a0at\nLeaseweb USA\u00a0in Manassas, Va., and\u00a0ISPrime\u00a0in Weekawken, New Jersey, accompanied by\u00a0U.S. federal\nmarshals. The two companies are now using the botnet\u2019s control channels to communicate with infected\nPCs and to notify affected users.\n\nAccording to Microsoft\u2019s lawsuit, Bamital is most often installed via drive-by downloads, which use\nexploit kits stitched into hacked and malicious Web sites. Microsoft said the bad guys behind the\nbotnet exclusively used the Phoenix Exploit Kit, a malware tool that uses vulnerabilities in Web\nbrowsers to silently install malware.\n\nBamital alters the organic search results on the host machine, redirecting victims away from sites\nas indexed by the major search providers toward pages that provide advertising and referral\ncommissions to affiliate marketers. Redmond included several examples in its petition to the court,\nsuch as when a victim with Bamital searches for Microsoft Halo, and upon clicking the top link in\nthe results is taken to a completely different set of search engine results.\n\nMicrosoft said Bamital also orders infected systems to participate in \u201cclick fraud,\u201d or to generate\nautomated Internet traffic by instructing those computers \u2014 without the owner\u2019s knowledge or\nintervention \u2014 to connect to any Web site chosen by the botmasters. Meanwhile, the owner of the\ninfected computer \u2013 even if they were sitting at the\u00a0computer \u2013 would not see the hidden browser.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why threats like Bamital are so prevalent: An estimated $12.7 billion was spent\non Internet advertising in 2012, and click fraud is taking a huge bite out of the expected returns.\nMicrosoft\u2019s own research indicates that 22 percent of all ad-clicks are fraudulent.\n\nThe takedown comes amid the release of even more alarming figures about bot-driven ad traffic. In\nits latest Bot Traffic Market Advisory issued today, New York-based ad network Solve Media said it\ntracked a \u201cstaggering\u201d spike in bogus bot traffic affecting ad networks in the 4th quarter of 2012;\nthe company estimates bots like those enslaved by Bamital cost marketers $1 billion in display ads\nand more than $2 billion in digital advertising investments.\n\nMicrosoft and Symantec told the court they believe that the fraudsters behind Bamital earned at\nleast $1 million a year in profits from the operation. In its lawsuit, Microsoft listed the email\naddresses and other information supplied by 18 \u201cJohn Does,\u201d individuals thought to be affiliated\nwith the scheme that Microsoft is hoping to identify.\n\nMicrosoft said all of the websites that it found were directing computers to the Bamital download\nsites installed a small \u201ccookie\u201d or text file on the user\u2019s computer. \u201cThe text of this particular\ncookie is \u2018yatutuzebil,\u2019 which is an approximate phonetic spelling of a Russian phrase loosely\ntranslating to, \u2018I was here already,'\u201d Microsoft wrote. \u201cIt is likely that the cybercriminals use\nthis cookie to identify computers that they have already probed.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft and Symantec both warn that Bamital was often bundled with other malware. The two\ncompanies are guiding victimized users toward free tools to help clean up the malware, including\nMicrosoft\u2019s Safety Scanner and Symantec\u2019s Norton Power Eraser.\n\nA copy of the lawsuit Microsoft filed is here (PDF); a supporting declaration with more information\nabout Bamital and its click fraud schemes is here (PDF).\n\n", "polarity": 0.08395496548905639, "subjectivity": 0.46831142342505977, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/01/adobe-microsoft-ship-critical-security-updates/", "date": "2013-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Adobe, Microsoft Ship Critical Security Updates", "body": "Adobe and Microsoft today separately issued updates to fix critical security vulnerabilities in\ntheir products.

In late December, Microsoft acknowledged that attackers were\nusing a previously undocumented security hole in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 8 to break\ninto Windows PCs. Microsoft later issued a stopgap \u201cFixIt\u201d tool to help lessen the vulnerability on\naffected systems, but researchers last week demonstrated that the FixIt tool only blocked some\nmethods of attacking the flaw, leaving other ways unguarded.

The legal victory also highlights a Chinese Internet service that experts say\nhas long been associated with targeted, espionage attacks against U.S. and European corporations.\n\nMicrosoft said it sought to disrupt a counterfeit supply-chain operation that sold knockoff versions\nof Windows PCs that came pre-loaded with a strain of malware called \u201cNitol,\u201d which lets attackers\ncontrol the systems from afar for a variety of nefarious purposes.\n\nIn legal filings unsealed Thursday by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,\nMicrosoft described how its researchers purchased computers from various cities in China, and found\nthat approximately 20 percent of them were already infected with Nitol.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear precisely how many systems are infected with Nitol, but it does not appear to be a\nparticularly major threat. Microsoft told the court that it had detected nearly 4,000 instances of\nWindows computers infected with some version of the malware, but that this number likely represented\n\u201conly a subset of the number of infected computers.\u201d The company said the majority of Nitol\ninfections and Internet servers used to control the botnet were centered around China, although\nseveral U.S. states \u2014 including California, New York and Pennsylvania \u2014 were home to significant\nnumbers of compromised hosts.\n\nDubbed \u201cOperation b70\u201d by Microsoft, the courtroom maneuvers are the latest in a series of legal\nstealth attacks that the software giant has executed against large-scale cybercrime operations.\nPrevious targets included the Waledac, Rustock, Kelihos and ZeuS botnets.\n\nThe core target of this takedown was 3322.org, a Chinese \u201cdynamic DNS\u201d (DDNS) provider. DDNS\nproviders offer typically free services that allow millions of legitimate users to have Web sites\nhosted on servers that frequently change their Internet addresses. This type of service is useful\nfor people who want to host a Web site on a home-based Internet address that may change from time to\ntime, because dynamic DNS services can be used to easily map the domain name to the user\u2019s new\nInternet address whenever it happens to change.\n\nUnfortunately, these dynamic DNS providers are extremely popular in the attacker community, because\nthey allow bad guys to keep their malware and scam sites up even when researchers mange to track the\nattacking IP address and convince the ISP responsible for that address to disconnect the miscreant.\nIn such cases, dynamic DNS allows the owner of the attacking domain to simply re-route the attack\nsite to another Internet address that he controls.\n\nMicrosoft told the court it found \u201ca staggering 500 different strains of malware hosted on more than\n70,000 subdomains\u201d at 3322.org. The court granted Microsoft temporary control over the name servers\nfor that domain. While 3322.org is owned by a Chinese firm, the dot-org registry is controlled by\nthe Public Interest Registry, a company based in Reston, Va.\n\nAlthough Microsoft did not explicitly address this in its filing, experts say 3322.org has long been\nassociated with malware used in highly targeted attacks aimed at stealing corporate and government\nsecrets from U.S. and other Western firms.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the interactions with the 3322.org hostnames for those outside of Asia \u2014\nparticularly those in the United States are malicious,\u201d said Steven Adair, a security expert with\nShadowserver.org, a nonprofit that helps ISPs track malware attacks. \u201cWhile not quite as prevalent\nnow, the 3322.org domain has been a hot spot for malware used to conduct cyber espionage for several\nyears now. We can already tell this move has had an impact on cyber crime operations.\u201d\n\nBut it is not clear how effective this action will be at blocking that activity, or more than\ntemporarily disrupting Nitol\u2019s operations.\n\nJoe Stewart, director of malware research for Dell SecureWorks, posted a message to Twitter.com this\nmorning noting that only 57 percent of the subdomains he\u2019s been tracking as related to targeted,\nespionage-type attack activity were disrupted by Microsoft\u2019s action.\n\nPart of the problem may be that much of the malware calling home to 3322.org has instructions built\ninto its genetic makeup to seek out commands and updates from many other dynamic DNS providers not\nimpacted by the court order, said Gunter Ollmann, vice president of research at security firm\nDamballa.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that we\u2019re currently tracking about 70 different botnets that had command and\ncontrol domain names within 3322,\u201d Ollmann said. \u201cBut all of those have secondary domain name\n[controllers] outside of 3322.org.\u201d\n\nPotentially complicating matters further, 3322.org now appears to be instructing affected users on\nhow to get around having their sites redirected to Microsoft\u2019s servers.\n\nMicrosoft has made the legal documents related to this case freely available from\nnoticeofpleadings.com.\n\n", "polarity": 0.07572379197379198, "subjectivity": 0.42564730314730315, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/05/microsoft-to-botmasters-abandon-your-inboxes/", "date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft to Botmasters: Abandon Your Inboxes", "body": "If the miscreants behind the ZeuS botnets that Microsoft sought to destroy with a civil lawsuit last\nmonth didn\u2019t already know that the software giant also wished to unmask them, they almost certainly\ndo now. Google, and perhaps other email providers, recently began notifying the alleged botmasters\nthat Microsoft was requesting their personal details.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s unconventional approach to pursuing dozens of ZeuS botmasters offers a rare glimpse into\nhow email providers treat subpoenas for account information. But the case also is once again drawing\nfire from a number of people within the security community who question the wisdom and long-term\nconsequences of Microsoft\u2019s strategy for combating cybercrime without involving law enforcement\nofficials.\n\nLast month, Microsoft made news when it announced a civil lawsuit that it said disrupted a major\ncybercrime operation that used malware to steal $100 million from consumers and businesses over the\npast five years. That legal maneuver may have upset some cyber criminal operations, but it also\nangered many in the security research community who said they felt betrayed by the action. Critics\naccused Microsoft of exposing sensitive information that a handful of researchers had shared in\nconfidence, and of delaying or derailing international law enforcement investigations into ZeuS\nTrojan activity.\n\nPart of the controversy stems from the bargain that Microsoft struck with a federal judge in the\ncase. The court granted Microsoft the authority to quietly seize dozens of domain names and Internet\nservers that miscreants used to control the botnets. In exchange, Microsoft agreed to make every\neffort to identify the \u201cJohn Does\u201d that had used those resources, and to give them an opportunity to\ncontest the seizure. The security community was initially upset by Microsoft\u2019s first stab at that\neffort, in which it published the nicknames, email addresses and other identifying information on\nthe individuals thought to be responsible for renting those servers and domains.\n\nAnd then the other shoe dropped: Over the past few days, Google began alerting the registrants of\nmore than three dozen Gmail accounts that were the subject of Microsoft\u2019s subpoenas for email\nrecords. The email addresses were already named in Microsoft\u2019s initial complaint posted at\nzeuslegalnotice.com, which listed nicknames and other information tied to 39 separate \u201cJohn Does\u201d\nthat Microsoft is seeking to identify. But when Microsoft subpoenaed the email account information\non those John Does, Google followed its privacy policy, which is to alert each of the account\nholders that it was prepared to turn over their personal information unless they formally objected\nto the action by a certain date.\n\nAccording to sources who received the notices but asked not to be named, the Google alerts read:\n\nUnlike most of its competitors in the Webmail industry, Google is exceptionally vocal about its\npolicy for responding to subpoenas. This has earned it top marks from privacy groups like the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which recently ranked ISPs and social media firms on the\ntransparency of their policies about responding to requests for information filed by the government\nor from law enforcement.\n\nGoogle spokeswoman Christine Chen said she could not comment on specific legal cases, but said the\ncompany complies with valid legal process.\n\n\u201cWe take user privacy very seriously, and whenever we receive a request we make sure it meets both\nthe letter and spirit of the law before complying,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWhen possible and legal to do so, we\nnotify affected users about requests for user data that may affect them. And if we believe a request\nis overly broad, we will seek to narrow it.\u201d\n\nAt least 15 of the email accounts named in Microsoft\u2019s lawsuit were addresses at hotmail.com or\nmsn.com, both free Webmail services run by Microsoft. It\u2019s not clear whether Microsoft gave those\naccount holders a heads up about the subpoena. I asked Richard Boscovich, the former Justice\nDepartment lawyer and one of the architects of Microsoft\u2019s legal strategy to target botnets with\ncivil actions; he didn\u2019t know, and referred me to Microsoft\u2019s compliance unit. I\u2019m still waiting for\nan answer. But it\u2019s worth noting that Google was the only email provider on EFF\u2019s list that was\nrecognized for reliably alerting users about data demands. Microsoft was not recognized on this\nfront.\n\nMarcia Hofmann, a senior staff attorney with the EFF, said Microsoft\u2019s legal effort underscores the\ntension between traditional law enforcement processes and companies using civil litigation to\nprotect their own users and to vindicate their own interests.\n\n\u201cI suspect this is a situation where Microsoft feels law enforcement isn\u2019t moving quickly enough,\u201d\nHofmann said. \u201cBut it also basically compromises law enforcement\u2019s ability to do anything about the\nproblem, and makes it possible for the suspects to evade any sort of law enforcement action.\u201d\n\nCUT-AND -PASTE JUSTICE?\n\nCritics of the Microsoft effort say certain clues prove that the company borrowed and published raw\nintelligence without fully understanding the data\u2019s true value and origins. Andy Fried, a former law\nenforcement official and owner of the Alexandria, Va. based security consultancy Deteque, was a co-\nfounder of the little-known ZeuS Working Group, an ad hoc and extremely secretive collection of law\nenforcement officials and private security professionals dedicated to tracking ZeuS activity with\nthe aim of bringing those responsible to justice.\n\n\u201cA basic tenet of this trust group is that everyone feels free to share data, but the rule is you\nnever release that data outside of the trust group without express permission of whoever provided\nthe data,\u201d Fried said. \u201cBut there was no way that the data Microsoft published was received\nindependently. Much of it was cut-and-pasted verbatim, and some of the data included in the search\nwarrant was horrifically out of date.\u201d\n\nFor instance, several of the key crime lords that Microsoft is seeking to unmask are already in\nprison for their crimes. John Doe #22 in Microsoft\u2019s complaint \u2014 alleged to have used the nickname\n\u201cJonni\u201d \u2014 is none other than Yevhen Kulibaba, a Ukrainian man arrested in London in 2010 and named\nas a ringleader of a money mule recruitment gang there. Kulibaba is currently serving a four-year\njail sentence in connection with the ZeuS activity.\n\nMicrosoft said John Doe #23 goes by the alias \u201cjtk,\u201d yet this was the nickname used by Yuriy\nKonovalenko, the 30-year-old accomplice of Kulibaba who also was arrested as part of the U.K.-based\nZeuS gang. Konovalenko likewise was sentenced to four years in jail.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s John Doe #24 is thought to go by the nickname \u201cVeggi Roma,\u201d but according to sources\nfamiliar with the case, this was an inside joke based on a lucky break that led police to the U.K.\ngang\u2019s location. Investigators in London had been working with the FBI to monitor the communications\nof several members of the London-based ZeuS gang, but for some time they did not know whereabouts of\nthe men, who were known at the time only as Jonni and Jtk. That is, until Jtk used his Internet\nconnection to order a pizza to be delivered to their apartment. A \u201cVeggi Roma\u201d pizza, to be exact.\n\nAstute readers may be wondering how it is that Google\u2019s emails and Microsoft\u2019s subpoenas to the John\nDoes named in the complaint are now public. According to Fried, that\u2019s because some of the email\naddresses listed in Microsoft\u2019s complaint as belonging to John Doe miscreants were in fact addresses\nused by security researchers who had registered domains to serve as \u201csinkholes\u201d for one or more ZeuS\nbotnets. Sinkholing is a practice by which researchers redirect the identification of the botnet\ncontrol servers to their own server, so that malicious traffic that comes from each bot-infected\nclient goes straight to the research box, ready to be analyzed.\n\nCOLLATERAL DAMAGE\n\nMicrosoft maintains that it worked with several security industry partners, and that it was\noperating under the assumption that the information those partners provided was either their own, or\nwas freely available amongst them for the purpose of securing the Internet.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Boscovich said the company did not work with law enforcement on this operation, and so\nhad no idea whether there were ongoing or adjudicated investigations related the John Does named in\nits case. He emphasized that protecting customers was the company\u2019s number one priority.\n\n\u201cOur main objective was to stop the bleeding, and everything we do is specifically related to that\nmission,\u201d Boscovich said. \u201cCongress specifically envisioned that it was and is appropriate for\nprivate entities to protect themselves and their interests, and as in this case, the interests of\nour customers. People are continuing to be victimized, computers compromised, identities stolen, and\nnow those systems are posing a threat to other people on internet, irrespective of what operating\nsystems they\u2019re using.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Fried said he believes Microsoft will soon find it more difficult to obtain sensitive\ninformation that security researchers and law enforcement gather about key cybercrime suspects. He\nalso fears that the ZeuS working group and other informal information-sharing groups may disband or\nbecome less effective as a result of this case.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft discounted everyone but themselves with their initial action, and they\u2019ve compounded\nthings pretty quickly with these subpoenas,\u201d Fried said. \u201cThis is also going to cause collateral\ndamage for a lot of trust groups, while all that they\u2019ve accomplished is little more than a very\nminiscule inconvenience to the bad guys, whose servers were back up within 24 hours of the\ntakdeowns.\u201d\n\nJon Praed, founding partner of the Arlington, Va. based Internet Law Group, said he\u2019s sympathetic to\nMicrosoft\u2019s position, and believes Google should have taken the trouble to investigate whether the\nJohn Doe accounts named in Microsoft\u2019s lawsuit deserved to be notified.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, most email providers have a one-size-fits-all privacy policy,\u201d Praed said. \u201cAll of\nthese companies have tried to create the legal right to do the right thing, but they\u2019re making\nalmost no attempt to apply that policy in practice. At the same time, Microsoft is spending a\ntremendous amount of money trying to stop this activity, and I don\u2019t know anyone else out there who\nis even trying to do this.\u201d\n\n", "polarity": 0.08216679154179156, "subjectivity": 0.4296614265364266, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/microsoft-responds-to-critics-over-botnet-bruhaha/", "date": "2012-04-16T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft Responds to Critics Over Botnet Bruhaha", "body": "Microsoft\u2019s most recent anti-botnet campaign \u2014 a legal sneak attack against dozens of ZeuS botnets \u2014\nseems to have ruffled the feathers of many in security community. The chief criticism is that the\nMicrosoft operation exposed sensitive information that a handful of researchers had shared in\nconfidence, and that countless law enforcement investigations may have been delayed or derailed as a\nresult. In this post, I interview a key Microsoft attorney about these allegations.\n\nSince Microsoft announced Operation B71, I\u2019ve heard from several researchers who said they were\nfurious at the company for publishing data on a group of hackers thought to be behind a majority of\nthe ZeuS botnet activity \u2014 specifically those targeting small to mid-sized organizations that are\ngetting robbed via cyber heists. The researchers told me privately that they believed Microsoft had\noverstepped its bounds with this action, using privileged information without permission from the\nsource(s) of that data (many exclusive industry discussion lists dedicated to tracking cybercriminal\nactivity have strict rules about sourcing and using information shared by other members).\n\nAt the time, nobody I\u2019d heard from with complaints about the action wanted to speak on the record.\nThen, late last week, Fox IT, a Dutch security firm, published a lengthy blog post blasting\nMicrosoft\u2019s actions as \u201cirresponsible,\u201d and accusing the company of putting its desire for a public\nrelations campaign ahead of its relationship with the security industry.\n\n\u201cThis irresponsible action by Microsoft has led to hampering and even compromising a number of large\ninternational investigations in the US, Europe and Asia that we knew of and also helped with,\u201d wrote\nMichael Sandee, Principal Security Expert at Fox IT. \u201cIt has also damaged and will continue to\ndamage international relationships between public parties and also private parties. It also sets\nback cooperation between public and private parties, so called public private partnerships, as\nsharing will stop or will be definitely less valuable than it used to be for all parties involved.\u201d\n\nSandee said that\u00a0a large part of the information that Microsoft published about the miscreants\ninvolved was sourced from individuals and organizations without their consent, breaking various non-\ndisclosure agreements (NDAs) and unspoken rules.\n\n\u201cIn light of the whole Responsible Disclosure debate \u00a0[link added] from the end of Microsoft this\nunauthorized and uncoordinated use and publication of information protected under an NDA is\nobviously troublesome and shows how Microsoft only cares about protecting their own interests,\u201d\nSandee wrote.\n\nGiven the strong feelings that Microsoft\u2019s actions have engendered in the Fox IT folks and among the\nlarger security community, I reached out to Richard Boscovich, a former U.S. Justice Department\nlawyer who was one of the key architects of Microsoft\u2019s legal initiative against ZeuS. One complaint\nI heard from several researchers who believed that Microsoft used and published data they uncovered\nwas that the company kept the operation from nearly everyone. I asked Boscovich how this operation\nwas different from previous actions against botnets such as Rustock and Waledac.\n\nBoscovich: It\u2019s essentially the same approach we\u2019ve done in all the other operations. The problem\nthat\u00a0I think some people have is that due to the type of operation, we can\u2019t have the entire\ncommunity involved. That\u2019s for several reasons. One is operational security. The bigger the number\nof people involved, the more likely is that is someone will make a mistake and say something that\ncould jeopardize all of the work that everyone has done. Also, we\u2019re making representations to a\nfederal court that this is an ex-parte motion and very limited people know about it. If you have\nmultiple people knowing, and the entire security community knows, let\u2019s say we submit declarations\nfrom 30-40 people. A court may say, \u2018Well there\u2019s a lot of people here who know about this, so isn\u2019t\nthis information that\u2019s already publicly available? Don\u2019t these people know you\u2019re looking at them\nalready?\u2019 We\u2019re really asking for an extraordinary remedy: an ex-parte TRO [temporary restraining\norder] is a very high standard. We have to show an immediate threat and harm, ongoing, so much so\nthat we can\u2019t even give the other side notice that we\u2019re going to sue them and take away their\nproperty.\n\nThe other concern is more operational. When I was in the Justice Department \u2014 I was there for just\nshy of 18 years \u2014 we even compartmentalized operations there. Information was shared on a need-to-\nknow basis, to make sure the operation would be a success and that there wouldn\u2019t be any inadvertent\nleaks. It wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t trust people, but because people sometimes make mistakes. So in\nthis operation, just like the others, we engaged with industry partners, academic partners, and some\nof those who wished to be open, and others who preferred to do things behind the scenes.\n\nKrebs: How do you respond to the criticism that Microsoft used and published data that came from\ncore members of the security community who had placed certain restrictions on the use of that data \u2014\nspecifically that permission be obtained before it is shared or published?\n\nBoscovich: Whenever we cooperate with the research community and industry partners, the assumption\nis that the information they provided is either their own, or is freely available amongst them for\nthe purpose of securing the internet.\u00a0They felt, we believe that all of this information should be\nused for the purpose for which it was intended: And that is to try to solve the problem and protect\npeople who are being victimized by crime.\n\nNow, there seems to be some allegations that there was information that one or two people provided\nto the research community \u2013which is very large by the way \u2014 which for some reason they didn\u2019t want\nto be acted upon. I don\u2019t know what that means, but we only ask for information from our industry or\nacademic partners that they believe is their own or is being freely shared in the community. The\npurpose for which we ask for this information is to reduce threat to consumers and people being\nvictimized by crime. If there are any allegations that somehow Microsoft knew this was privileged\ninformation, the answer is absolutely not. We respect the rights of others and the information we\nreceived \u00a0from academic or industry partners\u2026the representation was made to us that it was either\ntheir own work product, or it was made available by other researchers and that was freely shared\namongst them to be used for this type of purpose.\n\nKrebs:\u00a0The Fox IT researcher accused Microsoft of disrupting law enforcement investigations into\nmiscreants using ZeuS. Is that true?\n\nBoscovich:\u00a0Looking at the Fox-IT blog, I\u2019m disappointed by the fact that they talk about ongoing\ninvestigations. There\u2019s no way for us to know whether there\u2019s an ongoing criminal investigations\nfrom law enforcement. There\u2019s a litany of legal proscriptions and prohibitions in having that kind\nof information, so I\u2019m not sure how they would know. But obviously we don\u2019t. They omit the fact that\nin all of these operations, the objective is to notify and clean the victim\u2019s computers. In addition\nto disrupting, we want to help clean these computers.\n\nKrebs: And what about the criticism that Microsoft\u2019s actions actually took down legitimate sites?\n\nBoscovich: There were some mention that there were legitimate web sites that went down. But you\nknow, the law actually provides a mechanism on that. We put up a cash bond, and we explained to the\ncourt that we have a process in place in the event that a legitimate Web site goes down. There were\nseveral that were legitimate, but they had been compromised. Our people worked with those sites, and\nthey were not aware they were compromised. And although they were down an hour or two or three, they\nwould probably have never known they were being used by criminal organizations.\n\nKrebs: Some people have been critical of Microsoft\u2019s actions as \u201cvigilante\u201d activity, as\nparticipating in the sort of activity that should be left to the authorities. But Microsoft has\ntaken a slightly different approach, attacking this problem through the civil courts. Is there a\nconflict here, between these two approaches? Isn\u2019t there the possibility that Microsoft\u2019s actions on\nthe civil side could derail progress of law enforcement investigations working the criminal side?\n\nBoscovich: Our strategy, which is a disruptive strategy, came from the idea that there are two ways\nto tackle this problem; you have the very traditional law enforcement approach, which its ultimate\ngoal has always been that you have to have a well-identified target and arrest that person. We\u2019re\nnot saying necessarily that that\u2019s a bad model.\u00a0For years and years we fought drug dealers by trying\nto stop the drugs or stop the distribution. Until we said, why don\u2019t we disrupt them differently by\ngoing after their flow of money? And you saw this wave of legislation which came about as anti-money\nlaundering. And we began doing money laundering prosecutions, even though that particular case had\nabsolutely no drugs involved at all, but we were able to show some kind of taint.\n\nTaking that idea, we were able to literally start hitting the criminal enterprises and drug dealers\nwhere they really felt it \u2014 in their profits. Even though sometimes we didn\u2019t get many arrests, we\ngot seizures, forfeited accounts, forfeited cars, houses. Instead of trying to get the guys behind\nthis, we said why don\u2019t we just strike them where it\u2019s going to hurt them the most? And that is\ntheir criminal infrastructure \u2014 the botnets \u2014 which really allow them to leverage everything they\u2019re\ndoing and make a profit out of it. So we came up with Project Mars and the disruptive strategy.\n\nKrebs: Is it working?\n\nBoscovich: I\u2019d say it is working.\u00a0Recently, an article came out in the Wall Street Journal that\nmentioned a huge reduction in spam as a result of botnet takedowns. We\u2019ve taken down Waledac,\nRustock and Kelihos. All of them basically spam bots. But that disruptive activity has dented the\namount of spam that gets sent out. Even today. And I think that\u2019s a good proof point that the\ndisruptive approach works if you give it time and keep going at it.\n\nWhat we wanted to do with Zeus was continue with the disruptive approach, but in this case we didn\u2019t\ntarget one particular bot. We wanted to make our first assault a much broader assault, and that\u2019s\nwhy we went after a particular family of malware, all of them with the same code base, so that we\ncould bring it all together under one legal document, which is under a RICO statute. Kyrus did the\nmalware analysis and found that all these versions bubble back up to the same core code. We wanted\nto disrupt that business model as much as possible. We knew we were not going to fully eliminate one\nbot. That was never our intention. And I think we were pretty clear that this was the first salvo to\nthis whole group, to introduce a certain amount of entropy in there, and at that point to try to\nstart increasing the costs of them doing business.\n\nKrebs: It seems like the core dispute here is what should be done with information that is unearthed\nby security researchers, that the key question is how or who decides when and whether information\nabout certain bad actors should \u00a0be acted upon. Would you say that\u2019s accurate? And where do you come\ndown on that?\n\nBoscovich:\u00a0Microsoft is a pretty big company, and a lot of the stuff we do is based on our own\nresearch as well. But we really want to see other companies that have appropriate standing do their\nown actions. We really believe in the disruptive strategies. We believe that all of this information\nthat\u2019s out there\u2026and the community does amazingly good work in tracing this stuff\u2026but there comes a\npoint in time that you have to action on the information. All this information is great, but if you\ndon\u2019t action on it quickly, that data either becomes stale or it moves.\u00a0We really believe there are\npeople in industry and the academic and security community that want to have an impact and want to\nwork with us.\n\nKrebs: Were you aware that a number of people Microsoft named in its latest\u00a0John Doe\u00a0complaints are\nconsidered the core group of folks that the Justice Department has pegged as the guys behind the\noperations that cost businesses tens of millions of dollars over the last few years?\n\nBoscovich: Based on the investigation that we uncovered so far, we feel very confident that the\npeople we named, with the exception of a few guys that were lower-level players\u2026we feel confident\nwe\u2019ve named the right individuals involved. I really can\u2019t give you all the information we have,\nother than what\u2019s outlined in the pleadings. But I think the claim that somehow a civil action will\ndestroy all these criminal investigations\u2026I think that\u2019s a fallacy, and near-sighted, and it shows I\nthink a certain naivet\u00e9 based on not being in that world and not understanding how criminal\ninvestigations operate.\n\nKrebs: Can you talk about anything you\u2019ve learned since this action, in terms of the actors\ninvolved?\n\nBoscovich: There\u2019s more information that\u2019s coming in, and I feel confident that over the next\nseveral weeks and months that will translate into additional updates to the case, and we may amend\nour complaint. We also are happy to inform that as a result of being able to sinkhole the [ZeuS\ncontrol] IPs, we can get the location of these infected computers, and work with the community to\nget this information out. We believe we may be able to get this information out as early as sometime\nnext week.\n\nKrebs:\u00a0The Fox IT folks and others in the industry have characterized this initiative as little more\nthan a clever public relations stunt by Microsoft, designed principally to make the company look\nlike it is protecting customers from bad guys. How do you respond to that?\n\nBoscovich: It\u2019s not a black or white scenario like the Fox-IT people put it. I\u2019ve been doing this\nfor about 17 years 10 months, I know what very complex criminal investigations [are] and what works\nwell and what works not as well. It\u2019s appropriate and beneficial for both criminal and civil\nparallel proceedings, because they complement each other.\n\nFrom a company perspective, and this goes to the PR allegations, of course every corporation is a\nfor-profit corporation. We\u2019re not a charitable institution, obviously. But there are some times when\nit makes good business sense to actually do good in the community as well. It\u2019s one of those\nintersections where business and being a good corporate citizen actually complements each other. I\u2019m\nnot going to \u00a0be disingenuous and say we don\u2019t have a benefit in doing this. But I can also tell you\nwith a straight face that we do it also because we want to do the right thing, we want to protect\nour customers, and we want to protect people going on the Internet.\n\nWe\u2019re sort of like the emergency room physicians: When someone comes in and they\u2019re bleeding\nprofusely, you have to stabilize the patient and figure out how to stop the bleeding, so that the\nnext guy who comes \u2014 the surgeon \u2014 who\u2019s waiting in the operating room, is able to save the life of\nthat person.\u00a0From a\u00a0 civil perspective, we go in and want to help those victims. We want to stop the\nbleeding, save as many people as we can and clean their computers.\n\nThe question we have to ask ourselves is when you have information about millions of people who are\ncurrently victims of crimes because their systems are compromised, do you do the emergency room\nthing to try to stop the bleeding and try to clean those peoples\u2019 computers so they continue not to\nbe victimized? Or do you do nothing with the information? I think we\u2019ve been fortunate in working\nwith academic and industry partners to share information and address that problem.\n\nIn terms of identifying the actual cause, getting to the root, the defendants, all this information,\nwe\u2019re going to pass it on as we have in the past to law enforcement. But I think their investigation\nwill be enriched by a lot of things we can do legally simply because we are a victim and we have\naccess and resources to investigate these things. And then when we pass it along, I believe they\u2019re\nin a much better position to drill down and use the legal processes that they have \u2014 which we do not\nhave \u2014 to follow things such as money and financial trails and go overseas to international\nagreements.\n\nKrebs: With the benefit of hindsight, what \u2014 if anything \u2014 would you do differently about this\noperation, if you had to do it all over again?\n\nBoscovich: That\u2019s a good question. I was a little bit taken aback by some of the criticism in light\nof fact that nobody from fox-it called us to discuss or explain their concerns, or to why some\ndecisions were made legally. We always want to find ways to work with the community and the sharing\nof information is crucial to that. If you notice, every time we do one of these we have different\nacademic or industry partners that work with us, and we love to rotate those who do work with us.\nAnd the ones who want credit, we really try to make sure they get credit where it\u2019s due. We\nhopefully will try to explain this better, probably at the next DCC [Digital Crimes Consortium, an\nannual, invite-only Microsoft conference], that we\u2019re on the same team. I think we want the same\nobjectives, so hopefully we can bridge that gap and continue the work we\u2019re doing, to clean these\ncomputers, and to disrupt that ecosystem that is being utilized by the criminals.\n\nKrebs: In a nutshell, what would you like to get across or communicate better about this action?\n\nBoscovich: Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to explain that there are a lot of legal issues involved, and a\nlot of things we can and cannot do. Some of them many people may not be aware of. Which is\nunderstandable: they\u2019re not lawyers. These guys are technical in their field. In the same way I\ncan\u2019t reverse engineer malware, but I\u2019m pretty adept in understanding what are the limitations and\npotential liability issues when you do these operations. I hopefully can explain that aspect to\nthem, so they have a better understanding and appreciation that when we do things, why we do them\nthe way we do.\n\n", "polarity": 0.10053834525263093, "subjectivity": 0.438004302575731, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}, {"uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/03/microsoft-hunting-rustock-controllers/", "date": "2011-03-28T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Brian Krebs", "title": "Microsoft Hunting Rustock Controllers", "body": "Who controlled the Rustock botnet? The question remains unanswered: Microsoft\u2019s recent takedown of\nthe world\u2019s largest spam engine offered tantalizing new clues to the identity and earnings of the\nRustock botmasters. The data shows that Rustock\u2019s curators made millions by pimping rogue Internet\npharmacies, but also highlights the challenges that investigators still face in tracking down those\nresponsible for building and profiting from this complex crime machine.\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft crippled Rustock by convincing a court to let it seize dozens of\nRustock control servers that were scattered among several U.S.-based hosting providers. Shortly\nafter that takedown, I began following the money trail to learn who ultimately paid the botnet\ncontrollers\u2019 hosts for their services.\n\nAccording to interviews with investigators involved in the Rustock takedown, approximately one-third\nof the control servers were rented from U.S. hosting providers by one entity: A small business in\nEastern Europe that specializes in reselling hosting services to shadowy individuals who frequent\nunderground hacker forums.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity.com spoke to that reseller. In exchange for the agreement that I not name his\noperation or his location, he provided payment information about the customer who purchased dozens\nof servers that were used to manipulate the day-to-day operations of the massive botnet.\n\nThe reseller was willing to share information about his client because the customer turned out to be\na deadbeat: The customer walked out on two months worth of rent, an outstanding debt of $1,600. The\nreseller also seemed willing to talk to me because I might be able bend the ear of Spamhaus.org, the\nanti-spam group that urged ISPs worldwide to block his Internet addresses (several thousand dollars\nworth of rented servers) shortly after Microsoft announced the Rustock takedown.\n\nI found the reseller advertising his services on a Russian-language forum that caters exclusively to\nspammers, where he describes the hardware, software and connection speed capabilities of the very\nservers that he would later rent out to the Rustock botmaster. That solicitation, which was posted\non a major spammer forum in January 2010, offered prospective clients flexible terms without setting\ntoo many boundaries on what they could do with the servers. A translated version of part of his\nmessage:\n\nThe reseller said he had no idea that his customer was using the servers to control the Rustock\nbotnet, but he hastened to add that this particular client didn\u2019t attract too much attention to\nhimself. According to the reseller, the servers he resold to the Rustock botmaster generated just\ntwo abuse complaints from the Internet service providers (ISPs) that hosted those servers. Experts\nsay this makes sense because botnet control servers typically generate few abuse complaints, because\nthey are almost never used for the sort of activity that usually prompts abuse reports, such as\nsending spam or attacking others online. Instead, the servers only were used to coordinate the\nactivities of hundreds of thousands of PCs infected with Rustock, periodically sending them program\nupdates and new spamming instructions.\n\nThe reseller was paid for the servers from an account at WebMoney, a virtual currency similar to\nPayPal but more popular among Russian and Eastern European consumers. The reseller shared the unique\nnumeric ID attached to that WebMoney account \u2014 WebMoney purse \u201cZ166284889296.\u201d That purse belonged\nto an \u201cattested\u201d WebMoney account, meaning that the account holder at some point had to verify his\nidentity by presenting an official Russian passport at a WebMoney office. A former law enforcement\nofficer involved in the Rustock investigation said the name attached to that attested account was\n\u201cVladimir Shergin.\u201d According to the reseller, the client stated in an online chat that he was from\nSaint Petersburg, Russia.\n\nA LUCRATIVE PILL-PUSHING MACHINE\n\nAs it happens, that same WebMoney account is connected to three of the top promoters of \u201cSpamIt,\u201d a\nrogue pharmacy program that paid spammers millions of dollars to promote fly-by-night sites that\nsold counterfeit prescription drugs. SpamIt closed its doors in September 2010 when its alleged\nleader came under scrutiny from Russian authorities. The SpamIt financial books sent to me by an\nanonymous source last year include the ICQ numbers, phone numbers and financial account information\nfor hundreds of established criminal hackers and spammers. The SpamIt accounts show that a promoter\nusing the nickname \u201cCosma2k\u201d who used that WebMoney account was consistently among the top 10\nmoneymakers for SpamIt, and that he earned more than a half-million dollars in commissions over the\ncourse of three years with the pharmacy program.\n\nYet this appears to be only a fraction of Cosma2k\u2019s total earnings through SpamIt. The pharmacy\nprogram\u2019s records show that a Cosma2k affiliate also used at least one other WebMoney account that\nwas shared with two other top SpamIt members, accounts tied to the user names \u201cBird\u201d and \u201cAdv1.\u201d A\nreview of the account details for all three affiliates show they also all provided the same ICQ\nnumber at time of registration. The total commissions from all three user accounts at SpamIt was\nnearly $2.14 million over three-and-a-half years.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all: Those same three affiliate names \u2014 Cosma2k, Bird and Adv1 \u2014 also were registered\nusing the same ICQ account at Rx-Promotion, a competing rogue Internet pharmacy program. Rx-\nPromotion suffered a security breach last year in which its affiliate records were taken. A copy of\nthose records was shared with KrebsOnSecurity.com, and they show that these three accounts\ncollectively earned approximately $200,000 in commissions by promoting pharmacy Web sites for Rx-\nPromotion in 2010.\n\nIf Cosma2k really is responsible for Rustock, the payment data suggests either that he was sharing\ncontrol over the botnet with others, or that he split his promotion activities across multiple\naccounts, perhaps to keep legions of other affiliates from feeling resentful of his earnings and to\navoid calling undue attention to any one account. In fact, the SpamIt account belonging to Bird was\nby far the highest earning affiliate account in the entire history of program, and Bird routinely\nearned twice as much in commissions as the next most successful affiliate (which often enough was\neither Cosma2k or Adv1). In January 2010, for example, the SpamIt records show Bird\u2019s spam generated\nmore than $130,000 in pharmacy sales, while the next most successful affiliate for that month\nrealized about $86,000 in sales.\n\nAlex Lanstein, a network architect at FireEye, a Milpitas, Calif. based security firm that worked\nclosely with Microsoft on the Rustock takedown, said he doubts there were multiple people\nresponsible for running Rustock.\n\nIn fact, Lanstein said, bots such as ZeuS and Mega-D have shown that it doesn\u2019t take more than one\ncoder to be wildly successful. \u201cMost people probably assume that to be wildly successful in the\nworld of botnets, you need to have a huge team of programmers. Most malware these days is\nspecialized with only one or two real functions built-in,\u201d Lanstein said. \u201cWhy incur of the overhead\nof splitting profits when a bot operator can pay one-time fees to a 3rd party service and keep the\nreal profit for yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the barrier for entry into the malware game is extremely low, and when extradition is\ndifficult, and the criminals avoid affecting computers in their own country, the burden on law\nenforcement is extreme.\u201d\n\nSOFTWARE GIANT SEEKS BOTMASTER FOR COURTROOM DRAMA\n\nMicrosoft also was in communication with my informant reseller, and obtained much of the same data\nas I did. And the company plans to soon publish at least some of the information, albeit in a rather\nunusual way. According to Richard Boscovich, senior attorney for Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit,\nthe software giant seized the Rustock control servers by securing what\u2019s known as an \u201cex parte\ntemporary restraining order,\u201d which allowed Microsoft to take down the botnet without giving the\ndefendants advance notice.\n\nBut Microsoft is required by law to now make a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to contact the owner(s) of\nRustock control domains and other infrastructure the company has since seized, and to notify the\nindividual(s) of the date, time and location of an upcoming court hearing in Seattle, Washington,\nwhere the defendants will have an opportunity to be heard.\n\nMicrosoft will publish the information on a Web site set up for this purpose \u2013\nnoticeofpleadings.com. The company may also seek to publish the information in one or more major\nRussian newspapers, Boscovich said.\n\n\u201cWe will have to send out a notice to the individual or [group of] individuals we believe is behind\nthe bot,\u201d Boscovich said. \u201cWe will probably also serve notice of process in Russian newspapers or in\na Saint Petersburg newspaper, saying \u2018Hey, Mr. Such-and-Such, there is a court hearing in Seattle on\nthis case and we expect you to be there.'\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see who, if anyone, responds to the Microsoft notices, and whether the\nveil of anonymity will be lifted from the pseudonyms of botmasters, spammers, and account holders.\nStay tuned!\n\n", "polarity": 0.10259680134680131, "subjectivity": 0.4404461279461279, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article"}]
