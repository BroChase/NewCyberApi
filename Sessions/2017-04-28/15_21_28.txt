They are accompanied by a gag order preventing the recipient from disclosing\nthey\u2019ve received such an order. \n\nNSLs have been until fairly recently shrouded in secrecy. They are law enforcement\u2019s and\ngovernment\u2019s most powerful tool to compel companies such as technology and service providers to turn\nover a broad range of user data. In December, a NSL recipient who ran an ISP in 2004 was legally\ncleared to publicly reveal the contents of his NSL attachment. \n\nNicholas Merrill, owner of Calyx, fought his NSL in court for more than a decade before a judge\nruled in his favor that the FBI had not demonstrated that disclosing the contents of the attachment\nwould cause \u201cenumerated harm.\u201d \n\nThe unredacted attachment was published and showed that the FBI sought detailed personal subscriber\ninformation including browser history, IP addresses the subscriber connected to, six months of\nonline purchase history, email addresses, screen names and online aliases associated with a user\u2019s\naccount. The FBI also sought a radius log, which includes cell tower-based tracking information. \n\nReddit\u2019s transparency report is published annually and the organization said that there was a 78\npercent increase in the number of U.S. and foreign requests for disclosures. In total, Reddit\nreceived 98 requests for user information impacting 142 accounts; Reddit complied in 60 percent of\ncases. \n\nForeign requests shot up to 21 from five in 2014; Reddit complied in 71 percent of those requests. \n\nReddit for the first time received content removal orders (53) from governments outside the U.S. and\nsaid it complied in 21 percent of those requests. \n\n\u201cAlthough Reddit is a United States based company, we exercise our discretion to block content from\nbeing accessed by users in certain countries, where necessary to comply with local law, to preserve\nthe existence of Reddit in those countries,\u201d Reddit said in its report. \u201cWhen we receive an order\nfor removal of content, we review it to determine whether it violates local law, and, if so, we may\nblock the content from being accessed by the users in that country.\u201d \n\nRussia has the most requests (39) where all but one were requests for the removal of content related\nto the development, manufacture and use of illegal drugs.

The advisory urges organizations to employ common sense computer\nhygiene, starting with regular, available, secure backups of critical information. Application\nwhitelisting and vigilant patching are also recommended; the CERTS also caution that organizations\nshould educate users to avoid enabling macros. Many ransomware strains, including Locky, arrive in\nspam and phishing emails with Word documents posing as a business invoice. The victim is directed to\nenable macros in order to properly view the document, but instead the macro is downloading the\nransomware in the background. \n\nThe speed by which ransomware is evolving is striking, perhaps more so than any other type of\nmalware or exploit. \n\nIn the past two weeks, we\u2019ve seen PowerWare co-opt Windows PowerShell via a malicious macro to pull\ndown the ransomware and avoid writing files to the disk. \n\nMore recently, Petya ransomware was exposed in attacks targeting HR operations at German companies.\nThe twist with Petya is that it spreads via a Dropbox link\u2014which has since been disabled\u2014spammed out\nto organizations. The malware replaces the boot drive\u2019s Master Boot Record with a malicious loader.\nThe malware forces Windows to reboot and displays a phony check disk (CHKDSK) operation to the\nvictim while the malware executes in the background and encrypts the master file table. \n\nResearcher Hasherezade said in a detailed analysis posted to the Malwarebytes blog that despite\nclaims in the ransom note, Petya does not encrypt the full disk; by encrypting the master file\ntable, it makes it so that the file system is not readable. The ransomware executes in stages and\nHasherezade said that if detection happens in the first stage, data can be recovered. \n\n", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/us-canada-issue-ransomware-advisory/117157/", "date": "2016-04-04T00:00:00.000Z", "polarity": 0.07954902447089944, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "title": "US, Canada Issue Ransomware Advisory"}, {"subjectivity": 0.40666666666666657, "author": "Chris Brook", "body": "Clothing store Eddie Bauer has become the latest retail chain to acknowledge that malware has led to\na breach of its point of sale systems. \n\nIn a press release\u00a0(.PDF) late last week Eddie Bauer\u00a0confirmed that any customers who used a payment\ncard at a store over the past seven months, from January 2 to July 17, may be affected. \n\nWhen it comes to\u00a0exactly how many stores were affected by the malware, the notice is vague, but the\nway it\u2019s worded makes it sound as if point of sale systems at all 370 stores it operates, in the US\nand Canada, were hit by the malware. \n\nThe notice states that cardholder names, payment card numbers, security codes and expiration dates\nmay have been extracted by the malware. \n\nThe notification doesn\u2019t go into details around what type of malware it was or how Eddie Bauer\ndetected the breach.

The RATs are designed\nto determine if the systems on which they been installed are worthy of further exploitation.\n\nIf the endpoint appears promising, the operators of MajikPOS then use a combination of methods\nincluding VNC, Remote Desktop Connection, and command-line FTP to install the PoS malware. The goal\nis to find systems that are vulnerable without compromising the main weapon in their arsenal, Clay\nsays.\n\nOnce potential victims are identified, the attackers use a pair of executables to\u00a0run the attack \u2014\nan implant and a scraper for getting the card numbers. The approach ensures that if the initial\nstage of an attack fails, the core malware itself is not compromised, Clay says.\n\nThe method of attack indicates that the operators of MajikPOS have taken active precautions to\nmitigate the possibility of their malware being screened for and detected. This suggests that the\noperators of MajikPOS are also the authors the malware, Clay says.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of MajikPOS is that it is coded in .NET, which is a somewhat rare choice\nof a programming framework for malware authors.\n\nOnce installed on a system, MajikPOS inventories it thoroughly for payment card numbers, including\nlooking for them in memory, and then exfiltrates the data to its command-and-control server.\n\nTrend Micro's examination of one of the dumps showed it to contain over 23,000 stolen debit and\ncredit card track data. Prices for individual cards ranged from $9 to $39 depending on card type.\nBulk pricing ranged from $250 for a set of 10 cards to $700 for 100. Cards in the dump included\nthose issued by American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Diners Club.\n\nMeanwhile, in separate but related news, security blog KrebsOnSecurity\u00a0disclosed\u00a0what appears to be\na significant breach of PoS data at Select Restaurants, a company that owns several well-known,\nhigh-end restaurants around the country.\n\nThe breach, according to Krebs, is apparently tied to a previously disclosed intrusion at 24-7\nHospitality Technology, a PoS company that provides credit and debit card processing services to\nthousands of restaurants and eateries around the country.

But oftentimes, they are a strong indicator that something has\nchanged in that arena. \n\nPinterest, for example, in its 2015 transparency report reported the number of National Security\nLetter requests it had received as 0-249. Prior, it was just 0. \n\n\u201cWhat prompted this move? \u00a0Under\u00a0the law, a company that has received a national security request\ncan report in bands of 250, starting at 0, semiannually. Thus, there is certainly the strong\nimplication that Pinterest did receive a national security request, because it would have otherwise\nhave continued to report 0,\u201d wrote Electronic Frontier Foundation staff technologist Cooper Quintin. \n\nQuintin\u2019s observation was part of a larger announcement that the EFF along with the Freedom of the\nPress Foundation, NYU Law, Calyx, and the Berkman Center had decided to no longer maintain the\nCanary Watch project. \n\nLaunched more than a year ago, CanaryWatch.org was meant to be a repository listing warrant canaries\nand monitoring them for changes or removals, Quintin said. At the outset, the Canary Watch database\nwas 11 entries strong, and today there are close to 70. Quintin said that the project had achieved\nits goals and submissions of new canaries would no longer be accepted, and that the group would no\nlonger monitor existing canaries for changes. \n\n\u201cThe major strides in our understanding about the nature and current status of warrant canaries and\nnational security letters mean Canary Watch has definitely been a success. Moreover, it raised\nawareness and contributed to an important policy debate that is now well underway,\u201d Quintin wrote.\n\u201cIn contrast to the uncertainty a year ago, it now seems that the Internet at large can offer robust\nand decentralized monitoring of warrant canaries; the rapid spread of the news when reddit\u2019s canary\ndisappeared is a testament to that fact.\u201d \n\nOn April 1, Reddit published its most recent transparency report and missing was a notice present in\nits previous such report that it had never received a National Security Letter, FISA Court order or\nclassified order for user data. Quintin said in his report that since the removal of the Reddit\ncanary, searches for warrant canaries on the Canary Watch website \u201cgrew by an order of magnitude\u201d \n\n\u201cThe last year has, without a doubt, been a banner year for awareness of warrant canaries,\u201d he said. \n\nCanary Watch served a useful purpose given that prior to its inception, it was difficult to track\ntheir existence, especially post-Snowden as more ISPs, telecommunications providers and technology\ncompanies sought ways to communicate with customers in this regard. \n\nWarrant canaries are generally communicated through companies\u2019 transparency reports and are within\nthe scope of the law. Reporting on National Security Letters, for example, is prohibited by a court-\nimposed gag order. Statements such as Pinterest\u2019s and Reddit\u2019s stating that no such orders had ever\nbeen issued are the canaries; once those types of statements are removed, one can assume a secret\ncourt order for user data has been issued. \n\nQuintin said that organizations have also dropped canaries in PDFs, plaintext, HTML and images,\nwhile others were integrated into website banners or Github. \n\n\u201cWe have seen canaries that are signed using GPG, canaries that are part of a transparency report,\ncanaries that include the day\u2019s weather and top news headlines. We have seen canaries that are\nupdated on a daily basis and canaries which are updated once per year. We have seen canaries that\nwere created once and then never updated again,\u201d Quintin wrote. \u201cAgain, the fact that canaries are\nnon-standard makes it difficult to automatically monitor them for changes or takedowns.\u201d \n\nWarrant canaries are also always open to interpretation, fostered by subtle changes in grammar,\nwording or even URLs where statements are located. \n\n\u201cAll of this uncertainty caused numerous false alarms, which made it difficult to monitor warrant\ncanaries,\u201d Quintin wrote. \u201cAdditionally, this chaos served as a further demonstration of how\ndifficult it is to interpret what it means when a warrant canary changes.\u201d \n\n", "uri": "https://threatpost.com/canary-watch-project-runs-its-course/118320/", "date": "2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "polarity": 0.02136216056670602, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "title": "Canary Watch Project Runs Its Course"}, {"subjectivity": 0.36930894308943096, "author": "Brian Krebs", "body": "Clothing store chain\u00a0Eddie Bauer said today it has detected and removed malicious software from\npoint-of-sale systems at all of its 350+ stores in North America, and that credit and debit cards\nused at those stores during the first six months of 2016 may have been compromised in the breach.\nThe acknowledgement comes nearly six weeks after KrebsOnSecurity first notified the clothier about a\npossible intrusion at stores nationwide.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, KrebsOnSecurity reached out to Bellevue, Wash., based Eddie Bauer after hearing\nfrom several sources who work in fighting fraud at U.S. financial institutions. All of those sources\nsaid they\u2019d identified a pattern of fraud on customer cards that had just one thing in common: They\nwere all recently used at some of Eddie Bauer\u2019s 350+ locations in the U.S. The sources said the\nfraud appeared to stretch back to at least January 2016.\n\nA spokesperson for Eddie Bauer\u00a0at the time\u00a0said the company was grateful for the outreach but that\nit hadn\u2019t heard any fraud complaints from banks or from the credit card associations.\n\nEarlier today, however, an outside public relations firm\u00a0circled back on behalf of\u00a0Eddie Bauer. That\nperson\u00a0told me Eddie Bauer\u00a0\u2014 working with the FBI and an outside computer forensics firm \u2014 had\ndetected and removed card-stealing malware\u00a0from cash registers at all of its locations in the United\nStates and Canada.\n\nThe retailer\u00a0says it believes the malware was capable of capturing credit and debit card numbers\nfrom customer transactions made at all 350 Eddie Bauer stores in the United States and Canada\nbetween January 2, 2016 to July 17, 2016. The company emphasized that this breach did not impact\npurchases made at the company\u2019s online store eddiebauer.com.\n\n\u201cWhile not all transactions during this period were affected, out of an abundance of caution, Eddie\nBauer is\u00a0offering identity protection services to all customers who made purchases or returns during\nthis period,\u201d the company said in a press release issued directly after the markets closed in the\nU.S. today.\n\nGiven the volume of point-0f-sale malware attacks on retailers and hospitality firms in recent\nmonths, it would be nice if each one of these breach disclosures didn\u2019t look and sound exactly the\nsame. For example, in addition to offering\u00a0customers the predictable and irrelevant credit\nmonitoring services topped with bland assurances that the \u201csecurity of our customers\u2019 information is\na top priority,\u201d breached entities could offer the cyber defenders of the world just a few details\nabout the attack tools and online staging grounds the intruders used.\n\nThat way, other companies could use the information to find out if they are similarly victimized and\nto stop the bleeding of customer card data as quickly as possible. Eddie Bauer\u2019s spokespeople say\nthe company has no intention of publishing these so-called \u201cindicators of compromise,\u201d but\nemphasized that Eddie Bauer worked closely with the FBI and outside security experts.\n\nFor more on the importance of IOCs in helping to detect and ultimately\u00a0stymie\u00a0cybercrime, check out\nlast Saturday\u2019s story about IOCs released by Visa in connection with the recent intrusion at\nOracle\u2019s MICROS point-of-sale unit.\u00a0And for the record, I have no information connecting this breach\nor any other recent POS malware attack with the breach at Oracle\u2019s MICROS unit.

Gallagher said he and members of\n@malwrhunterteam and @MalwareTechBlog recently got into a Twitter fight with the author of Orcus\nRAT,\u00a0a tool they say was explicitly designed to help users remotely compromise and control computers\nthat don\u2019t belong to them.\n\nThe author of Orcus \u2014 a person going by the nickname \u201cCiriis Mcgraw\u201d a.k.a. \u201cArmada\u201d\u00a0on Twitter and\nother social networks \u2014 claimed that his RAT was in fact a benign \u201cremote administration tool\u201d\ndesigned for use by network administrators and not a \u201cremote access Trojan\u201d as critics charged.\nGallagher and others took issue with that claim, pointing out that they were increasingly\nencountering computers that had been infected with Orcus unbeknownst to the legitimate owners of\nthose machines.\n\nThe malware researchers noted another reason that Mcgraw couldn\u2019t so easily distance himself from\nhow his clients used the software: He and his team\u00a0are providing ongoing technical support and help\nto customers who have purchased Orcus and are having trouble figuring out how to infect new machines\nor hide their activities online.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the range of features and plugins supported by Armada, they argued, go well beyond what\na system administrator would look for in a legitimate remote administration client like Teamviewer,\nincluding the ability to launch a keylogger that records the victim\u2019s every computer keystroke, as\nwell as a feature that lets the user peek through a victim\u2019s Web cam and disable the light on the\ncamera that alerts users when\u00a0the camera is switched on.\n\nA new feature of Orcus announced July 7 lets users configure the RAT so that it evades digital\nforensics tools used by malware researchers, including an anti-debugger and an option that prevents\nthe RAT from running inside of a virtual machine.\n\nOther plugins offered directly from Orcus\u2019s tech support page\u00a0(PDF) and authored by the RAT\u2019s\nsupport team include a \u201csurvey bot\u201d designed to \u201cmake all of your clients do surveys for cash;\u201d a\n\u201cUSB/.zip/.doc spreader,\u201d intended to help users \u201cspread a file of your choice to all clients via\nUSB/.zip/.doc macros;\u201d a \u201cVirustotal.com checker\u201d made to \u201ccheck a file of your choice to see if it\nhad been scanned on VirusTotal;\u201d and an \u201cAdsense Injector,\u201d which will \u201chijack ads on pages and\nreplace them with your Adsense ads and disable adblocker on\u00a0Chrome.\u201d\n\nGallagher said he was so struck by the guy\u2019s \u201csmugness\u201d and sheer chutzpah that he decided to look\ncloser at any clues that Ciriis Mcgraw might have left behind as to his real-world identity and\nlocation. Sure enough, he found that Ciriis Mcgraw also has a Youtube account under the same name,\nand that a video Mcgraw posted in July 2013 pointed to a 33-year-old security guard\u00a0from Toronto,\nCanada.\n\nGallagher noticed that the video \u2014 a bystander recording on the scene of a police shooting of a\nToronto man \u2014 included a link to the domain policereview[dot]info. A search of the registration\nrecords attached to that Web site name show that the domain was registered to a John Revesz in\nToronto and to the email address john.revesz@gmail.com.\n\nA reverse WHOIS lookup ordered from\u00a0Domaintools.com shows the same john.revesz@gmail.com address was\nused to register at least 20 other domains, including \u201cthereveszfamily.com,\u201d \u201cjohnrevesz.com,\nrevesztechnologies[dot]com,\u201d and \u2014 perhaps most tellingly \u2014 \u00a0\u201clordarmada.info\u201c.\n\nJohnrevesz[dot]com is no longer online, but this cached copy of the site from the indispensable\narchive.org includes his\u00a0personal r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which states that John Revesz is a network security\nadministrator whose most recent job in that capacity was as an IT systems administrator for TD Bank.\nRevesz\u2019s LinkedIn profile indicates that for the past year at least he has served as\u00a0a security\nguard for GardaWorld International Protective Services, a private security firm based in Montreal.\n\nRevesz\u2019s CV also says he\u2019s the owner of the aforementioned Revesz Technologies, but it\u2019s unclear\nwhether that business actually exists; the company\u2019s\u00a0Web site currently redirects visitors to a\nseries of sites promoting spammy and scammy surveys, come-ons and giveaways.\n\nContacted by KrebsOnSecurity, Revesz seemed surprised that I\u2019d connected the dots, but beyond that\ndid not try to disavow ownership of the Orcus RAT.\n\n", "uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/", "date": "2016-07-21T00:00:00.000Z", "polarity": 0.09412356649198754, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "title": "Canadian Man Behind Popular \u2018Orcus RAT\u2019"}, {"subjectivity": 0.4575230880230879, "author": "Brian Krebs", "body": "When a retailer\u2019s credit card systems get breached by hackers, banks usually can tell which merchant\ngot hacked soon after those card accounts become available for purchase at underground cybercrime\nshops. But when companies that collect and sell sensitive consumer data get hacked or are tricked\ninto giving that information\u00a0to identity thieves, there is no easy way to tell who leaked the data\nwhen it ends up for sale in the black market. In this post, we\u2019ll examine one idea to hold consumer\ndata brokers more accountable.\n\nSome of the biggest retail credit card breaches of the past year \u2014 including the break-ins at Target\nand Home Depot \u2014 were detected by banks well before news of the incidents went public. When cards\nstolen from those merchants go up for sale on underground cybercrime shops, the banks often can\nfigure out which merchant got hacked by acquiring a handful of their cards and analyzing the\ncustomer purchase history of those accounts. The merchant that is common to all stolen cards across\na given transaction period is usually the breached retailer.\n\nSadly, this process of working backwards from stolen data to breach victim generally does not work\nin the case of breached data brokers that trade in Social Security information and other data,\nbecause too often there are no unique markers in the consumer data that would indicate from where\nthe information was obtained.\n\nEven in the handful of cases where underground crime shops selling consumer personal data have\nincluded data points in the records they sell that would permit that source analysis, it has taken\nyears\u2019 worth of very imaginative investigation by law enforcement to determine which data brokers\nwere at fault. In Nov. 2011, I wrote about an identity theft service called Superget[dot]info,\nnoting that \u201ceach purchasable record contains a two- to three-letter \u201csourceid,\u201d which may provide\nclues as to the source of this identity information.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the world didn\u2019t learn the source of that ID theft service\u2019s data until 2013, a year\nafter U.S. Secret Service agents arrested the site\u2019s proprietor \u2014 a 24-year-old from Vietnam who was\nposing as a private investigator based in the United States. Only then were investigators able to\ndetermine that the source ID data matched information being sold by a subsidiary of big-three credit\nbureau Experian (among other data brokers that were selling to the ID theft service). But federal\nagents made that connection only after an elaborate investigation that lured the proprietor of that\nshop out of Vietnam and into a U.S. territory.\n\nMeanwhile, during the\u00a0more than six years\u00a0that this service was in operation, Superget.info\nattracted more than 1,300 customers who paid at least $1.9 million to look up Social Security\nnumbers, dates of birth, addresses, previous addresses, email addresses and other sensitive\ninformation on consumers, much of it used for new account fraud and tax return fraud.\n\nInvestigators got a lucky break in determining the source of another ID theft service that was\nbusted up and has since changed its name (more on that in a moment). That service \u2014 known as\n\u201cssndob[dot]ru\u201d \u2014 was the service used by exposed[dot]su, a site that proudly displayed the Social\nSecurity, date of birth, address history and other information on dozens of Hollywood celebrities,\nas well as public officials such as First Lady Michelle Obama, then FBI Director Robert Mueller, and\nCIA Director John Brennan.\n\nAs I explained in a 2013 exclusive, civilian fraud investigators working with law enforcement gained\naccess to\u00a0the back-end server that was being used to handle customer requests for consumer\ninformation. That database showed that the site\u2019s 1,300 customers had spent hundreds of thousands of\ndollars looking up SSNs, birthdays, drivers license records, and obtaining unauthorized credit and\nbackground reports on more than four million Americans.\n\nAlthough four million consumer records may seem like a big number, that figure did not represent the\ntotal number of consumer records available through ssndob[dot]ru. Rather, four million was merely\nthe number of consumer records that the service\u2019s customers had paid the service to look up. In\nshort, it appeared that the ID theft service was drawing on active customer accounts\u00a0inside of major\nconsumer data brokers.\n\nInvestigators working on that case later determined that the same crooks who were running\nssndob[dot]ru\u00a0also were operating a small, custom botnet of hacked computers inside of several major\ndata brokers, including LexisNexis, Dun & Bradstreet, and Kroll. All three companies acknowledged\ninfections from the botnet, but shared little else about the incidents.\n\nDespite their apparent role in facilitating (albeit unknowingly) these ID theft services, to my\nknowledge the data brokers involved have never been held publicly accountable in any court of law or\nby Congress.\n\nCURRENT ID THEFT SERVICES\n\nAt present, there are multiple shops in the cybercrime underground that sell everything one would\nneed to steal someone\u2019s identity in the United States or apply for new lines of credit in their name\n\u2014 including Social Security numbers, addresses, previous addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth,\nand in some cases full credit history. The price of this information is shockingly low \u2014 about $3 to\n$5 per record.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity conducted an exhaustive review of consumer data on sale at some of the most popular\nunderground cybercrime sites. The results show that personal information on some of the most\npowerful Americans remains available for just a few dollars. And of course, if one can purchase this\ninformation on these folks, one can buy it on just about anyone in the United States today.\n\nAs an experiment, this author checked two of the most popular ID theft services in the underground\nfor the availability of Social Security numbers, phone numbers, addresses and previous addresses on\nall members of the Senate Commerce Committee\u2018s Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety\nand Insurance. That data is currently on sale for all\u00a0thirteen Democrat and Republican lawmakers on\nthe panel.\n\nBetween these two ID theft services, the same personal information was for sale on Edith Ramirez and\nRichard Cordray, the heads of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB), respectively.\n\nGetting these ID theft service Web sites shut down might feel good, but it is not a long-term\nsolution. Both services used to conduct these lookups of the public figures mentioned above are\nsecond- and third-generation shops that have re-emerged from previous takedown efforts. In fact, at\nleast one of them appears to be a reincarnation of ssndob[dot]ru, while the other seems little more\nthan a reseller of that service.\n\nRather, it seems clear that what we need is more active\u00a0oversight of the data broker industry, and\nnew tools to help law enforcement (and independent investigators) determine the source of data being\nresold by these identity theft services.\n\nSpecifically, if there were a way for federal investigators to add \u201cbreach canaries\u201d \u2014 unique, dummy\nidentities \u2014 to records maintained by the top data brokers, it could make it far easier to tell\nwhich broker is leaking consumer data either through breaches or hacked/fraudulent accounts.\n\nData brokers like Experian have strongly resisted calls from regulators for greater transparency in\ntheir operations and in the data that they hold about consumers. When the FTC recommended the\ncreation of a central website where data brokers would be listed \u2014 with links to these companies,\ntheir privacy policies and also choice options, giving consumers the capability to review/amend the\ndata that companies maintain \u2014 Experian lobbied against the idea, charging that it would \u201chave the\nunintended effect of confusing consumers and eroding trust in e-commerce.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s main sticking point\u00a0was essentially that it was unfair to impose such requirements on\nthe bigger data brokers and ignore the rest. Experian\u2019s chief lobbyist Tony Hadley\u00a0has made the\nargument that there are just too many companies that have and share all this consumer data, which\nseems precisely the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Direct Marketing Association (DMA) estimates that even a narrow definition of a marketing\ninformation service provider is likely to include more than 2,500 companies from all sectors of the\neconomy,\u201d Hadley wrote in a blog post earlier this year. \u201cSimply put, the entire data industry \u2013\nextremely vital to the US economy \u2014 cannot be neatly or accurately identified and then subjected to\nunrealistic requirements.\u201d\n\nMy guess is that if the data broker giants are opposed to the idea of inserting dummy identities\ninto their records to act as breach canaries, it is because such a practice could expose data-\nsharing relationships\u00a0and record-keeping practices that these companies would rather not see the\nlight of day. But barring any creative ideas\u00a0to help investigators quickly learn the source of data\nbeing sold by identity theft services online, data brokers will remain free to\u00a0facilitate and even\nprofit from an illicit market for sensitive consumer information.\n\n", "uri": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/toward-a-breach-canary-for-data-brokers/", "date": "2014-12-08T00:00:00.000Z", "polarity": 0.08452078477078476, "_cls": "CyberSpiders.articlemodel.Article", "title": "Toward a Breach Canary for Data Brokers"}, {"subjectivity": 0.3879734407007134, "author": "Brian Krebs", "body": "In a\u00a0move that may wind up helping spammers, Microsoft is blaming\u00a0a new Canadian anti-spam law for\nthe company\u2019s recent decision to stop\u00a0sending\u00a0regular emails about security updates for its Windows\noperating system and other Microsoft software.\n\nUpdate, 5:39 p.m. ET: In an apparent reversal, Microsoft now says it will be re-instating the\nsecurity notifications via email. Please read the update at the end of this post.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nLast week, Microsoft sent the following notice to IT professionals and others who have signed up to\nreceive email notices of security updates:\n\n\u201cAs of July 1, 2014, due to changing governmental policies concerning the issuance of automated\nelectronic messaging, Microsoft is suspending the use of email notifications that announce the\nfollowing:\u201d\n\n* Security bulletin advance notifications  * Security bulletin summaries  * New security advisories\nand bulletins  * Major and minor revisions to security advisories and bulletins\n\n\u201cIn lieu of email notifications, you can subscribe to one or more of the RSS feeds described on the\nSecurity TechCenter website.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more information, or to sign up for an RSS feed, visit the Microsoft Technical Security\nNotifications webpage at http://technet.microsoft.com/security/dd252948.\u201d\n\nAsked about the reason for the change, a Microsoft spokesperson said email communication was\nsuspended to comply with a new Canadian anti-spam law that takes effect on July 1, 2014.\n\nSome anti-spam experts who worked very closely on Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law (CASL) say they are baffled\nby Microsoft\u2019s response to a law which has been almost a decade in the making.\n\nNeil Schwartzman, executive director of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email (CAUCE),\nsaid CASL contains carve-outs for warranty and product safety and security alerts that would more\nthan adequately exempt the Microsoft missives from the regulation.\n\nIndeed, an exception in the law says it does not apply to commercial electronic messages that solely\nprovide\u00a0\u201cwarranty information, product recall information or safety or security information about a\nproduct, goods or a service that the person to whom the message is sent uses, has used or has\npurchased.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am at a complete and total loss to understand how the people in Redmond made such an apparently\npanicked decision,\u201d Schwartzman said,\u201d noting that Microsoft was closely involved in the discussions\nin the Canadian parliament over the bill\u2019s trajectory and content. \u201cThis is the first company I know\nof that\u2019s been that dumb.\u201d\n\nSchwartzman said\u00a0many companies have used CASL as an excuse to freshen up their email lists and to\nre-engage their customers. Some have even gone so far as to enter\u00a0respondents who verify that they\nstill want to receive email communications from a company into drawings for cash prizes and other\ngiveaways.\n\n\u201cOver the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve seen nothing but a steady stream of reconfirmation mails from\nvarious companies,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m now in the running for several $500 dollar gift certificates\nbecause I confirmed my email. And at the bottom of each of these messages is a note that says\n\u2018please ignore this offer if you\u2019re not Canadian.'\u201d\n\nCAUCE board member Jeff Williams, a former group program manager at Microsoft\u2019s Malware Protection\nCenter, chalked Microsoft\u2019s decision up to a little more than a tough call.\n\n\u201cI can imagine the discussion and wondering among the lawyers and [Microsoft] whether they should\ntry to get hundreds of millions of opt-ins before\u00a0June 30\u00a0or if they should change the way they\nshare info,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but I wouldn\u2019t call it\nan overreaction.\u201d\n\nIn addition to pushing notices about new updates out via\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s RSS feeds, the company also\nappears to be making the security email alerts available to users who have Live, Outlook or Hotmail\naccounts with Microsoft. And of course, readers can continue to rely on KrebsOnSecurity to feature\ninformation on any new security updates available from Microsoft, including each Patch Tuesday\nbundle as well as emergency, \u201cout-of-band\u201d updates released to address zero-day security threats.\n\nUpdate, 5:40 p.m. ET: In an apparent reversal of its decision, Microsoft now says it will be re-\nstarting its security notifications via email early next month. From a Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson: \u201cOn\nJune 27, 2014, Microsoft notified customers that we were suspending Microsoft Security Notifications\ndue to changing governmental policies concerning the issuance of automated electronic messaging.
